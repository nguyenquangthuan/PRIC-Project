Executive Summary
There are many proposals to further develop water resources in northern Australia. However,
there are many potential uses of available water and many other questions remain to be answered
before sustainable utilisation of available water can be achieved. In addition, the issues that need
to be investigated are different in each catchment, requiring locally-derived solutions. To assist in
this process, the CRC for Developing Northern Australia has developed a program – Water
Security for Northern Australia – to fund research into key issues for sustainable utilisation of water
resources in northern Australia. This program has identified 4 key focal nodes where pressure for
increased water utilisation is high – Gilbert (QLD), Daly-Katherine (NT), Ord (WA), and lower
Fitzroy (QLD) – to be the focal nodes for this research program. To determine the most
appropriate research questions for each focal node, we undertook a co-design phase with relevant
regional stakeholders in each focal node. This co-design phase and its outcomes are described
here. The result includes the generation of 15 research projects that are now proposed for funding
under the Water Security for Northern Australia program.

Introduction
One of the most likely prospects for economic growth for northern Australia is the
development of water resources. However, there are many considerations involved in
establishing sustainable water resource development, especially in a distant, remote, and
often harsh environment, such as northern Australia.
A particular challenge to developing water resources in northern Australia is that there is a
need for concurrent developments in inputs (such as skilled labour and supply chains) and
outputs (such as irrigation systems, processing facilities and value-added systems) to make
schemes viable. This complicates planning and approval processes, as it requires a systems
approach to identifying necessary inputs, uses and outputs of water resources in contrast to
the atomistic approaches that are typically used.
One way of tackling the complexity of a systems approach to new water resources is to
apply a case study lens by focusing on a precinct development rather than simply providing
more water resources. Focusing within a precinct constrains the problem to be more
manageable while maintaining the focus on what is the real challenge – how to plan and
organise development at a systems level to efficiently use water from a new precinct.
The CRC for Developing Northern Australia (CRCNA) has developed a program around
Water Security for Northern Australia. It is intended that this program would develop and
implement a series of research projects that address problematic issues that are
constraining sustainable water resource utilisation in 4 key precincts or focal nodes across
northern Australia. These focal nodes are (Gilbert (QLD), Daly-Katherine (NT), Ord (WA)
and lower Fitzroy (QLD)). These focal nodes were selected by the CRCNA based on prior
assessments and consultation indicating they are likely locations of further water resource
development pressure. In order to develop such a series of research projects, it was first
required that the relevant stakeholders in each focal node be engaged in a co-design
process. The co-design phase of the Water Security for Northern Australia program has
spent 4 months engaging with relevant stakeholders in the 4 focal nodes. This process and
outcomes of this co-design phase is reported here. The engagement process and research
priorities identified by stakeholders during the co-design phase for each focal node are
presented. Of the identified research priorities, a series of 15 priorities were selected for
development into research proposals to be considered for funding under the implementation
phase of the Water Security for Northern Australia program. These proposals are also
presented here in the Appendices.
8
Engagement process and stakeholder research prioritisation
The co-design process was conducted from August-November 2022. The contextual
environment for each focal node is different, largely depending on government processes
and the state and regional history of water resource development. Thus, stakeholder
engagement within each focal node has been approached differently, and the issues
associated with each region also differs substantially. The co-design process undertaken in
each focal node is described below:
The general principle is that key lead actors in each focal node were identified by the
CRCNA for initial consultation. These lead actors were either individuals or established
stakeholder groups. From this initial discussion, the stakeholder engagement was widened
to include other stakeholders relevant to each node/focal region. Workshops were held in
each node to share information and discuss emerging priorities. Consultation was also
conducted by node leaders outside the node stakeholders. For example, with researchers
familiar with the nodes or other government agency staff or relevant people. In each node,
the engagement process was led by a node leader, funded through the current CRCNA
project. These node leaders were Associate Professor Nathan Waltham (Gilbert node), Dr
Dylan Irvine (Ord and Daly-Katherine nodes), and Professor John Rolfe (lower Fitzroy node).
The overall program was coordinated by Professor Damien Burrows and Dr Yvette Williams
and this group of 5 leaders collectively reported to a CRCNA project manager (Anthony
Curro) and the CRCNA Chief Scientist – Professor Alan Dale who had established contact
with the major actors in each node prior to project commencement, and who participated in
many of the stakeholder engagement events reported here.

Contextual Background
The Gilbert River catchment is located in the Gulf region of north-west Queensland (Figure
1) and covers an area of 46,200 km2
. It has a population of approximately 1200 with the
largest urban centre being Georgetown (population of 243). It has a semi-arid tropical
climate, with a mean and median annual rainfall spatially averaged across the catchment are
775 mm and 739 mm respectively (Petheram et al. 2013). The historical annual rainfall
series for the Gilbert catchment shows considerable variation between years. The highest
catchment mean annual rainfall (2187 mm) occurred in 1974, and was nearly three times the
median annual rainfall value (farmers, however, outline that the rainfall is pretty reliable).
Spatially, mean annual rainfall varies from about 1050 mm on the coast in the north of the
catchment to about 650 mm in the south-east of the catchment.

al. (2013))
Regional vegetation communities in the Gilbert catchment consists mostly of not of concern
dominant (Figure 2). There are extensive areas that hold of concern sub-dominant and
dominant communities, particularly over much of the upper Einasleigh and most of the
coastal plains. Small areas support endangered sub-dominant and dominant communities,
particularly in the upper Einasleigh catchment. Much of the regional ecosystems of elevated
significance are either located along drainage lines or on floodplains thus indicating some
form or extent of water dependence.

sourced from Queensland Government. Definitions in Vegetation Management Act 1999 (Waltham et
al. 2013).
The landscape of the catchment must be considered against a background of significant
historical climate variation and shifting landmasses which provide a key to understanding
contemporary distributions of species and communities. For much of the Pleistocene age
(approximately 2.6 million years before present to 10,000 years ago) Australia was part of
the Sahul landmass which comprised the Australian mainland, Tasmania and New Guinea.
During this period a series of ice ages reduced sea levels and exposed land bridges across
the globe including the Australia–New Guinea continental shelf and putatively connected
many rivers across northern Australia. During the last glacial episode the Gulf of Carpentaria
was dominated by a large inland lake, Lake Carpentaria (Torgersen et al. 1985). Evidence
for the existence of this large inland lake from studies of sediments and organic matter
trapped within them, suggest that this lake oscillated between brackish and freshwater
before the final incursion of marine waters into the lake at around 10,800 years before
present (Reeves et al. 2007).
The current day fragmented distributions and low endemicity of many freshwater fish and
crustaceans throughout the Gulf region probably reflects this historical hydrological
connectivity with Lake Carpentaria acting as a conduit that periodically allowed species to
move between the rivers of the Gulf. This pattern of periodic connection and movement is
supported by genetic research on a variety of freshwater fauna in the Gulf rivers including
11
pennyfish (Denariusa bandata), redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus), giant freshwater
prawn (Macrobrachium spinipes; formally Macrobrachium rosenbergii until Ng and Wowor
(2011)), spangled perch (Leiopotherapon unicolor) (Bostock et al. 2006, Baker et al. 2008,
Cook et al. 2011). However, the timing for when freshwater faunas across northern Australia
became disjunct and fragmented into the distributions found today is unclear. The
Pleistocene age was characterised by drier periods of lower rainfall which may have played
a part in limiting the exchange of species across northern Australia and further afield
(Unmack 2001). However, this is a complicated story as even today, large floods may
establish connectivity between adjacent river systems, facilitating dispersal of freshwater
biota and mixing of gene pools.
In a review and classification of the hydrology of northern Australian river systems (Kennard
et al. 2010) revealed that the upper and middle reaches of the Gilbert catchment were
grouped into class 10 (predictable summer; highly intermittent flow), although a stable
summer base flow (class 3) was also identified. An extensive appraisal of the river hydrology
has been completed as part of the Flinders Gilbert Agricultural Resources Assessment,
including wetland connectivity in lower catchment and coastal floodplain (Karim et al. 2015),
while river system flows under climate change and proposed development scenarios is in
another companion report (Petheram et al. 2013). McJannet et al. (2014) also examined the
persistence of dry season waterholes and determined that the duration of zero flow is
typically much longer in the Flinders catchment, particularly in the Cloncurry and midFlinders, compared to the Assessment areas in the upper Gilbert catchment. These
assessments were critical for the proposed development precincts identified in the
catchment at the time, and though useful some of the data are generally considered limited
in a spatial context. Understanding the water resource development potential in the
catchment needs to consider broader consequences, particularly downstream areas and
ecosystems, including a large commercial fisheries sector (Kenyon et al. 2004, Burford et al.
2010, Kenyon and Donovan 2012, Robins et al. 2020). In addition to coastal fisheries, the
tidal coastal mudflats provide incredibly important habitat for migratory birds which is a
consequence of the nutrient and sediment rich floodwater flows from the Gilbert and other
catchments in the southern gulf (Burford et al. 2016, O'Mara et al. 2022). There has also
been major die back of mangroves along the most of the gulf coastline, including the Gilbert
River estuary and coast (Duke et al. 2017).
Unlike other Gulf of Carpentaria catchments, the Gilbert River catchment has significant
prospects for development (Alluvium 2022), where under the Gulf Water Plan 2007 there is
an allocation of 467, 000 ML of water for agricultural use, however, only a small proportion
(~10%) has been activated. The main reasons for this relates to stringent land clearing
approval requirements, environmental significance of the catchment and its downstream
floodplain to coastal fisheries, and the cost to prepare documents for approval to develop
and build the water infrastructure. Given the strong desire to increase development and use
the allocated water in the catchment, the timing of this research project is ideal, with the
results and outcomes having direct impact on several major initiatives underway in the
catchment, including the Etheridge Shire’s Etheridge Agricultural and Irrigation Precinct
project proposal and the Gulf Water Plan review which is commencing in 2025 ahead of a
2027 release.

Engagement with the Gilbert River catchment stakeholders
To assist in the coordination and governance of stakeholder engagement in the Gilbert River
node for the WSNA program a Technical Reference Group (TRG) for the Gilbert River
catchment was convened and chaired by the Etheridge Shire Council, with members drawn
from various landholders, government agencies, NRM and Indigenous partners, and will
likely continue to expand as the various programs and projects continue over the coming
years (Table 1). Membership of the TRG is voluntary and it has the key roles to:
• Advise and guide research design to ensure the project meets the needs of the
Gilbert Catchment project and is aligned with the needs of the Etheridge Agricultural
and Irrigation Precinct project;
• Provide access to data, research reports, other documents, and contacts, to support
the researchers’ objectives;
• Identify and advise on risks and issues, as they arise during implementation stage;
and
• Communicate effectively and collaboratively with stakeholders and researchers.
The TRG met four times during the co-design phase and development of the forward-looking
research projects for the catchment. The meeting dates were 14 October 2022, 4 November
2022, and 18 November 2022, and a final co-design meeting on 9 December 2022. All
meetings were held on-line and attended by members to ensure the effective design of the
research projects. From February 2023 until the completion of the project, it is anticipated
that TRG will continue to meet regularly, to assist with the implementation and impact of the
research results particularly given the agricultural development opportunities in the
catchment.

Priority issues raised
The discussions and contribution offered by TRG members during the co-design process
was professional and positive, the group has also increased membership since the first
meeting, which was a positive sign on the level of interest and expertise needed to oversee
research in the catchment. Each meeting had an agenda which was followed and there was
a continual process of opening the floor to members to raise concerns and questions -
following a good governance model. Some of the important points/messages raised during
the meeting included:
• Need to examine ecosystem services under threat with any developments planned in
the catchment;
• Concerns about downstream economically important fisheries;
• Indigenous cultural values and opportunities for water development;
• Lack of environmental data for the catchment;
• Need for coordination and information share of knowledge in the catchment; and
• Use of existing data and reports completed in the catchment under previous
investment.
During these meetings it was identified that WSNA research program would need to closely
integrate with the Etheridge Shire Agricultural and Irrigation Precinct project that is jointly in
preparation with Etheridge Shire Council and Regional Development of Australia Tropical
North. During TRG meetings, it was agreed that the alignment between these two projects
was important and would ensure support and share of information to ensure strong
outcomes for the region.
In addition to the TRG meetings, numerous individual stakeholder meetings were held, via
online meetings (some up to 2hrs), to further understand and define the critical issues and
concerns, and development barriers and opportunities in the catchment. These meetings
were very well received, Stakeholders appreciated the opportunity to participate in the codesign phase. Some of the main concerns raised were:
• Development in the catchment and changes in the delivery of nutrient and sediment
rich freshwater may have undesirable consequences for primary production in the
estuary and nearshore zone. This primary production provides important basal
sources for fisheries production and nearshore important feeding and resting areas
for migratory shorebirds.
• The State Government will start preparation for the Gulf Water Plan review in 2025,
ahead of a revised plan for release 2027 for the region. This project timing is
therefore important and could provide meaningful data as part of the plan review.
• Need to ensure research projects align with what community, council and landholders
desire for the catchment, and the vision to ensure the information is shared and
trusted by partners.
During the co-design period there have been also several other projects operating. The
Node Leader for the Gilbert has kept involved in these via a range of workshops, online
meetings and discussions to ensure these additional projects are considered in the WSNAA
project herein. These additional projects included:
• Strategic Assessment of Agricultural development potential (Mitchell, Flinders and
Gilbert catchments – led by Alluvium Consulting);
14
• CSIRO – State and transition models to support ecosystem accounts in Flinders,
Norman and Gilbert River catchments;
• Griffith University, NESP Resilient Landscape Hub, research in Gilbert, Flinders, and
Mitchell Catchments to train rangers to collect environmental data; and
• Etheridge Shire Development Precinct.
All these projects and identified information gaps were important and useful in formulating
the research projects proposed under the WSNA (Table 2).

Project 1: Floodplain, rivers and tributary aquatic flora and fauna inventory
There is limited, explicit, aquatic flora and fauna (including water quality) data
collected in the Gilbert River and the tributaries. Studies completed to date have
been restricted to proposed development precincts (e.g. Flinders and Gilbert
Agricultural Resources Assessment) and floodplain areas (TraCK). The Gulf
Water Plan uses species data to test and set flow hydrometrics for species
presumed or historically documented in the region. According to Australian Living
Atlas, the sawfish (Pristis pristis) and the freshwater whipray (Urogymnus
dalyensis) are known in the catchment, with the sawfish listed as critically
endangered under the EPBC Act 1999 (the sawfish is an indicator species for
development impacts on waterholes in the Ord River catchment). This research
project focuses on firstly completing a literature review of previous field surveys in
the catchment to inform gaps in knowledge in the catchment. With this knowledge,
and in consultation with our project partners, an inventory of aquatic flora and
fauna species in various habitats within the catchment will be completed. Once
completed, we will then overlay functional and lifecycle ecology trait requirements
on current distribution to understand the potential future risks to development in
the catchment (this same approach has been applied in the Ord River for
example). For rare and threatened species, and those aquatic species modelled in
the Gulf Water Plan (e.g. catfish, purple spot gudgeon, freshwater turtles) specific
habitat requirement surveys and manipulative experiences will be completed to
determine sensitivity to altered flow and environmental conditions in the future (e.g.
thermal and oxygen exposure risks in key refugia under future expected
conditions). These data will assist the Queensland Government in the review of
the Gulf Water Plan and preparation of the next iteration due 2027. In addition, the

data will be useful for any planned future monitoring and evaluation of

Project 2: Persistence and extent of waterholes in the Gilbert River and
tributaries, and groundwater contribution to permanency
Seasonal rivers of northern Australia remain connected following the wet season
for a period, until flow ceases when they then gradually become disconnected and
exist as a series of waterholes. These waterholes gradually further dry as the
season continues, some completely, through for some that remain in a permanent
state until the next wet season are critical freshwater refugia habitat for species.
While permanent waterholes are critical resources, they are also susceptible to
poor water quality conditions, particularly as the dry season advances, some
reaching conditions that are intolerable for some aquatic life. The balance and risk
that these permanent waterholes face until the next wet season means they are
also at risk from land use changes, which might pose a threat to their utility as
important refugia habitat. For example, land use change might change important
limnological processes (i.e., making them more turbid, or changing the diel cycling
of oxygen and temperature) meaning that the waterholes contribute little to broader
ecosystem services. In addition, we plan to also evaluate the interaction of water
flow and waterhole distribution in the catchment in relation to river bed sands.

Project 3: Examining the ecosystem services gained and lost for proposed
development areas
A major barrier to development in the Gilbert River catchment, despite available
water for development, is the prohibition on broadscale clearing of natural
vegetation unless the project has been declared a coordinated project under the
State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971 (Qld) and such

clearing is approved. This declaration requires the approval of the CoordinatorGeneral and involves the requirement for preparation of an EIS or other form of
impact assessment. This can be an expensive and time-consuming process and is
considered to be beyond the resources of individual proponents for all but the
largest of developments. Other approvals are also required and of these, approval
under the application of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation
Act 1999 (Cwlth) is probably the most onerous. Even with coordinated project
status, there is no certainty that broadscale clearing will be approved unless it can
be shown to be sustainable with minimal risk, if any, to the environment. This
requires at the very least that the remaining natural vegetation post-development
provides adequate biodiversity and other ecosystem services within the context of
the broader catchment and that management is required. Planning should seek to
avoid, minimise, or mitigate impacts on values. As a last resort, offsets
(biodiversity) may be required to ensure that proposed clearing is sustainable.
A separate issue is soil carbon. Local data (20 year time series) is available at
some locations/farms and this suggests that carbon sequestration is accruing due
to farming techniques, possibly at a greater rate than in natural vegetation. Other
data at other properties may be available and may assist in obtaining a broad
picture of the role of advanced farming techniques across the catchment. While
carbon sequestration is unlikely to be considered to be an offset to biodiversity
losses, it is nonetheless a factor in considering development proposals as a whole.

Project 4: Indigenous values mapping and water resource enterprise product
identification
The Gulf of Carpentaria holds incredible natural resources and many of these are
important to Indigenous people and their connection with Country. There is an
allocation of water in the Gilbert River catchment for Indigenous enterprise/use,
however, access and use of the allocated water has not progressed. There is a
critical need to work closely with TO groups, to drive forward the identification and
document cultural values in the Gilbert River catchment (akin to the Walking the
Landscape developed by DES). Preliminary research was completed during the

CSIRO Flinders Gilbert Agricultural Resources Assessment to identify cultural
values in the catchment, but this was limited to a small area, to within the identified
development areas for that study. In this research project, there is a critical need
to engage and consult TO groups in the catchment, to map out the natural
resources that includes Indigenous cultural areas, and to develop a plan of
enterprise development for water use that is prosperous for groups (based on
cultural values calendar or similar approaches). This project could be supported by
the CRC for Indigenous and Environmental and Futures (JCU). By way of
example, this research project might focus on freshwater turtles in the catchment,
which hold cultural value, and require access to suitable habitat for breading
(riparian areas on banks) and access to appropriate waterholes for feeding and
shelter. Freshwater turtles are heavily predated on by feral animals, for example
pigs, which could be also impact populations in this catchment. Freshwater turtles
are also a key species used in the hydrometric modelling for water resource
planning in the region. This project aims to firstly, map the natural resources that
relate to cultural values, and in doing so identify potential enterprise product
opportunities. Secondly it will also complete a threats analysis that development
poses to the values (e.g. freshwater turtles) and identify implementation strategies
for conservation and protection of these cultural valued resources in the
catchment.

Priority research areas going forward
From the range of research priorities discussed during the co-design phase, four were
selected to be put forward for the implementation phase of the WSNA program:
Project 1.1 – Floodplain, rivers and tributary aquatic flora and fauna inventory
Project 1.2 – Persistence and extent of waterholes in the Gilbert River and tributaries,
groundwater contribution to permanency
Project 1.3 – Examining the ecosystem services gained and lost for proposed
development areas
Project 1.4 – Indigenous values mapping and water resource enterprise product
identification
These projects were all identified as addressing major issues of relevance for the catchment
where results could potentially have major impacts on the viability and scope of future
operations and developments. Importantly, there has been a focus on providing data and
information for a range of project partners, given the huge potential for development and the
ecological sensitivity of the region. Further details are provided in Appendix A.
Daly River Catchment - Katherine
Node lead – Dr Dylan Irvine, CDU
Contextual Background
The Daly River Catchment (Figure 3) includes the townships of Pine Creek and Katherine,
where Katherine is approximately 320 km south of Darwin. Rainfall is distinctly seasonal
throughout the catchment, where mean monthly rainfalls are generally lowest (<10 mm)
between May and September (peak dry season) and highest (>100 mm) between December
and March (wet season) (Erskine et al 2003). The mean annual rainfall generally increases
from the south-east to north-west, ranging from 690 mm at Willeroo to 1300 mm at Daly
River (Erskine et al 2003).
There are several rivers within the catchment, including the Daly, Douglas, Flora, Katherine,
amongst many others (Erskine et al 2003, also, see Fig. 1 below). Groundwater plays an
important role in sustaining year round flows in several of these rivers, including (but not
limited to) the Katherine River (Northern Territory Government, 2019a) and the Daly River
(Northern Territory Government, 2019b), where groundwater discharges to springs from the
underlying Tindall Limestone and/or Oolloo Dolostone aquifers. Given the connection
between groundwater and surface water in the catchment, groundwater and surface water
are conjunctively managed in both the Katherine-Tindall Limestone Aquifer (Northern
Territory Government, 2019a) and the Oolloo Dolostone Aquifer (Northern Territory
Government, 2019b) Water Allocation Plans.
The Daly River Catchment supports a broad range of agricultural activity including hay,
melons, and mangoes, as well as some forestry (Northern Territory Government 2022a). A
2016 investigation identified that for profitable broadacre crops to be grown in the region, a
two crop cropping system is likely required to generate suitable cash flow, with likely crops
including peanuts, aromatic rice and/or mung beans (North Australian Agribusiness
Management, 2016). Research projects have been proposed in the catchment that
investigate both agricultural and water resources-based questions.
The original area proposed to investigate included both the Daly and Roper River
catchments. However, the project area was refined to the Daly catchment, partially due to
the fact that the Daly has greater agricultural development, and to avoid overlap with
22
projects being conducted in the Roper catchment by CSIRO, funded through the National
Water Grid Authority (CSIRO, 2022).
Proposed research projects in the Daly catchment were selected to (a) improve the
understanding of water requirements of ecosystems and investigated potential impacts from
proposed surface water take, (b) to understand motivations and barriers to further
agricultural development in the area, (c) to investigate water sources of springs that
discharge to the Daly River and to inform the conceptualisation of a numerical groundwatersurface water model, and (d) to investigate potential impacts of future climate change on
future water resources. The focus on potential climate change may inform each of the
previous projects, as well as projects within the Water Security for Northern Australia WSNA
Program

Engagement with the Daly River catchment -Katherine stakeholders
The Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade (DITT) has been the primary contact in the
development of the research program for the Daly River Catchment. The Department of
Environment, Parks and Water Security (DEPWS) have also played a central role in the
development of the research plan. The research questions were developed through consultation
with the government departments, and refined through further consultation with the departments,
universities and the project management working group.
Workshops were held on the 3rd and 10th of November. The workshops were slightly delayed due
to staff absences from the relevant departments. The technical reference group contained senior
representatives from NT Farmers, the Northern Land Council (NLC), the Malak Malak Ranger
group, the Northern Western Australia and Northern Territory Drought Resilience Adoption and
Innovation Hub (The Northern Hub), the Environment Centre NT and Regional Development
Australia (RDA). Representatives from The Amateur Fishing Association NT (AFANT) and the
Northern Australian Indigenous Land and Sea Management Alliance (NAILSMA) were unable to
attend the workshops.
The consultation process was driven through meetings that were held on an as needs basis with
both DITT and DEPWS. Both in person and Microsoft Teams were used for meetings, with
meeting times generally varying between 1-2 hours. In addition to official meetings, information
was exchanged throughout the co-design process via emails and conversations at numerous
conferences and events attended by government departments and researchers from CDU (i.e., the
Voices in the Bush and Water in the Bush conference, meetings of the International Association of
Hydrogeologists, and regular research meetings between the government departments and CDU).
In addition to meetings with stakeholders, discussions were held amongst CDU researchers, and
regular updates on progress were provided to the Gilbert and Rookwood node leaders (Dr Nathan
Waltham, James Cook University and Prof John Rolfe, Central Queensland University) and
relevant researchers from each university.

Water allocations involving water from the Daly River where it overlies the
Oolloo Dolostone rely on a coupled numerical surface water-groundwater
model. The model is run during the wet season to project water availability for
the remainder of the year to inform the Annual Announced Allocations (AAAs).
The model currently poorly reproduces river flows, requiring adjustments to
model outputs prior to projections being made. This mismatch is likely driven by
poor representation of key hydrological processes and creates the potential for
undesirable issues with water allocation.
A project that has the goals of (1) determining the origins of water from a select
number of springs, and (2) identifying likely causes for model mismatch has
been requested. This project also provides the ability to work with Traditional
Owners to document changes in spring condition, and for two-way learning on
hydrological function of the springs. Groundwater tracers will be used to
determine spring water origins, with the goal to identify water sources, and
potential limitations from the existing numerical model.
This work will improve the understanding of the system, providing greater surety
for water managers, and may inform local scale water allocations (i.e. in the
capture zone of important springs), whilst protecting sites of cultural
significance.

Proposing Org: DEPWS –
Investigation of the potential impacts of the proposed draft surface water take
policy (Northern Territory Government, 2022b) were proposed by DEPWS, with
significant interest from multiple members of the technical reference group. The
proposed policy follows the decision-making hierarchy of (1) scientific work to
define suitable volumes of extraction, (2) contingency rules based on typical wet
season flows (5% of the lowest quartile of the wettest months over the
preceding 50 year period).
Surface water take during the wet season is expected to influence river flows
and floodplains/ wetlands throughout the year. These impacts may include
hydrological and ecological function of the river and floodplain environments.
Investigating the likely impacts of surface water take on the Daly (or other rivers
in the catchment) could focus on: reduction in bank storage and associated
return flows, investigating the paired use of aerial imagery/ remote sensing and
river flow statistics to investigate ecosystem health during dry years (as a proxy
for future conditions), and investigating the longitudinal and lateral connectivity
of pools and floodplains to determine the potential impacts to key species
(through their full life cycle) and ecosystems.

Impacts of climate future climate change (i.e., changes in rainfall patterns and
increases in temperature) are important factors across all of Australia,
particularly northern Australia.
The project will gather spatial (gridded) climatic datasets (both historical and
projections) from global climate modelling. While primarily focused on the
Northern Territory, and potential changes in water future water availability, the
project will likely generate outputs that inform other projects within the Water
Security Program. The Bureau of Meteorology have recently produced a CSA
tool (Australian Government, 2022) which is intended to inform farmers about
potential changes to temperature and rainfall. Utilising the data that underpins
the tool will allow further, more detailed hydrogeological investigations.
Communicating this tool with potential users is an additional component to the
project.
Outputs from the project will likely include a review of potential climate impacts
across northern Australia, a case study that investigates potential changes in
groundwater recharge, as well as providing data outputs to inform other projects
within the program.

Proposing Org: DITT – Utilisation of the Strategic Aboriginal Water
Reserves and Indigenous-led development on Indigenous land
Northern Territory Water Allocation Plans (WAPs) reserve a proportion of
allocatable water to be utilised for Strategic Aboriginal Water Reserves
(SAWRs). This water, were available, can be used by Traditional Owners.
Issues with the approach occur, where regions are already over-allocated,
resulting in new water (i.e., to SAWRs water) in the system being unavailable.
One possibility, where water is available, but there is no intention for SAWRs to
be used for development, is for this water to be traded to generate income.
While the NT currently does not have a charge for water, water can generate a
value if new developers wish to come into a system that is already fully
allocated.
This project was ultimately not selected, given the fact that the issues limiting
the SAWRs are policy issues that are not readily impacted by further research.

Proposing Org: DITT – Trial crop testing on the Katherine research farm
Development in the Northern Territory is often hindered by developers moving
to the NT with an incomplete understanding of the challenges involved. i.e.
challenges in obtaining a water licence, restrictions on clearing, unknown pests,
and challenges in the distance to market. Limited understanding of operating in
the Norther Territory has led to farm developments failing before harvesting a
crop.
A potential solution to these problems is for potential crops to be grown on the
DITT research station where cleared land and a water licence is available. If
crops can be demonstrated to be viable and suitable to the Northern Territory,
they can then be rolled out on a commercial scale, thus reducing risks to be
assumed by potential developers.
Farming/cropping experts from CQU highlighted that this kind of project is only
successful with significant input from commercial industries, rather than projects
driven by governments and/or universities. This project likely has merit but is not

The Flora River Region, within the Daly Catchment, is one of the next regions
where a water allocation plan will be developed. Both recent investigations
through the Strategic Regional Environmental and Baseline Assessment
(SREBA) studies into potential impacts from shale gas extraction, and previous
studies of the area have shown that it is hydrogeologically complex. For
example, the system of sinkholes likely lead to rapid groundwater recharge,
potentially leading to mixing with much older waters from further to the south of
the basin.
Rainfall over the last 30 years is generally higher than the long-term average in
the area. This point could potentially explain the increase in water stored in the
aquifer.
Further work is required to better understand this system. While this work is
important, it was given a lower priority than other projects. The field-based
nature of the project makes it difficult to accommodate this project with other

the region is either fully allocated, or over-allocated, meaning that new
developments in the area are limited (whether they have Traditional Owner
support or not). Further challenges include the skill sets available at CDU, JCU
and CQU. The project is important, but would require significant inputs/support,

Priority research areas going forward
Following consideration of which of the above suggested topics are best suited to the WSNA
program, the below projects were selected to be put forward to the CRCNA for funding. Detailed
research proposals for these can be found in Appendix B.
Topic Summary
Project 2.1 - Oolloo Dolostone spring water
origins project (DEPWS).
This project was selected as it has direct
potential to inform/improve the allocation of
water in the Daly Catchment. The project
directly aligns with skills at CDU and
provides opportunities for genuine
collaboration with Traditional Owner groups
to determine water requirements to sustain
culturally significant springs. The project
aims to improve the understanding of spring
flow mechanisms to improve the current
numerical model that is used in the
determination of annual announced
allocations of water.
Project 2.2 - Impacts of reduced flows on
ecosystems (DEPWS).
This project alights with the interests of
DEPWS to understand the water use
requirements of ecosystems and allows the
investigation of potential impacts of a new
NT Government surface water take policy
on key species and floodplain/wetland
ecosystems. The project also directly aligns
with expertise at CDU and JCU. The project
will investigate potential impacts of surface
water take on floodplains using available
river flow and remote sensing data. The
project will conduct targeted field work to
validate the outcomes of the remote
sensing work.
Project 2.3 - Potential impacts of future
climate change (DITT and DEPWS).
This project is vitally important to a research
program into water security. Outputs from
the project will lead to research outputs in
its own right and will inform several other
projects. Further input from climate
scientists (outside of CDU, JCU or CQU)
will be required for its successful delivery.
The project will utilise outputs from global
climate models to inform potential impacts
to water resources in catchments in
northern Australia.
33
Project 2.4 - Understanding farmer
motivations and barriers to change (DITT).
This project started with the goal to
determine what is required for farmers to
make the transition to higher value crops.
To get to this point, DITT require an
understanding of soils, potential crops and
their water requirements, potential climate
change and crop suitability, plus an
understanding of motivating factors and
current barriers to further development. This
project leverages off of other projects
(climate change impacts, related questions
in the Ord) and utilises input from
researchers at CQU. The research will be
driven by a mixed methods social science
research approach to understand farming
practices. These outputs will inform a paired
plant growth-water use and economic
modelling.
Ord River Catchment - Kimberley
Node lead – Dr Dylan Irvine, CDU
Contextual Background
Irrigated agriculture in the Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) began with the completion of the
Kununurra Diversion Dam and main irrigation channel in 1963 (DPIRD, 2021a). The ORIA is often
referred to in two parts:
• Stage 1 – the original irrigated farmland comprising 14,500 ha (DPIRD, 2021a), and
• Stage 2– the expanded farmland area of Goomig and Knox comprising approximately 13,000
ha of irrigated land (at full development) enabled by the extension of the main irrigation
supply channel and other public infrastructure in 2012 and 2013.
Whereas the Stage 1 farming area is comprised of many, smaller farms, the Stage 2 farming area
is comprised of two large farming areas, Goomig and Knox. Figure 4 shows the extent of the first
two stages.
Irrigated agriculture development is also proposed for Carlton Plain and Mantinea adjacent to the
lower Ord River (Figure 2). Carlton Plain Stage 1 is approved and under development.
Future expansion of the ORIA to the Keep River Plains in the Northern Territory has also been
proposed.
34
Figure 6: Map of the Ord River Irrigation Area (Provided by the Department of Primary Industries and
Regional Development, DPIRD).
35
Figure 7. Carlton Plain and Mantinea development areas (map provided by the Department of Primary
Industries and Regional Development, DPIRD).
The significant agricultural outputs from the ORIA, as well as the water use requirements to
produce these outputs make the strong case for its inclusion in the CRCNA Water Security for
Northern Australia (WSNA) Program. Originally, two key research themes were introduced in the
ORIA:
(1) an investigation of water use efficiency, with a focus on the implementation of tail water
recycling (associated with Stage 1 farms), and
(2) impacts on water quality, with a focus on the Keep River which is habitat for EPBC listed
species (associated with Stage 2 farms).
Three research outputs have been proposed for the ORIA:
(a) Through the co-design process, the research question related to water use efficiency and
tailwater recycling was modified, owing to the fact that retrofitting tailwater recycling was identified
as an approach that would only likely be implemented following several other measures first being.
implemented. The revised approach to research in the Stage 1 farming area aims to gain an
understanding of farmers' current and potential future farming practices and to gain an
understanding on their thoughts of potential water management in the region.
(b) To investigate agricultural runoff monitoring methods and data (especially for pesticides) to
determine risks, and following this investigation, to potentially design an optimal sampling strategy
for the system.
36
(c) Finally, a review of catchment/water management in tropical catchments was proposed. This
review can cover both Australian and international management plan examples, as well as a
review of peer-reviewed literature to document management approaches and their potential
benefits to inform water management in the ORIA.
Engagement with the Ord River catchment stakeholders
The research questions were developed through consultation with the Western Australian (WA)
Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) and were refined through
further consultation, the WA Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER),
universities and, local stakeholders (which included farmers, members of the Goomig Independent
Review Group, amongst others). DPIRD was the primary contact throughout the consultation
process.
Meetings with government organisations were held using Microsoft Teams, aside from the
workshops held in Kununurra on the 27th and 28th of October. Generally, meetings varied in
duration between 30 minutes and 2.5 hours, depending on the size of the group involved in the
meeting. Given the interest from farmers in the area, rather than a dedicated Technical Reference
Group, the two workshops were attended by multiple organisations and farmers/ farming
companies. Organisations in attendance included DPIRD, DWER, Kimberley Agricultural
Investment, Ceres Farm, Ord Irrigation Corporation, the president of the Shire of Wyndham East
Kimberley, Acadia Farms, Oasis Farms, Boab Metals, the Independent Review Group and the
Northern Hub.
The consultation process was driven through meetings that were held on an as needs basis,
predominantly driven by DPIRD. In total, 11 dedicated Ord meetings were held between
September 20th and November 25th. The meetings prior to the workshops included the DPIRD,
DWER and Water Corporation. In addition to formal meetings, the project design process benefited
from regular contact with Renee Zuks from DPIRD to organise meetings and the workshops.
In addition to meetings with stakeholders, discussions were held amongst CDU researchers, and
regular updates on progress were provided to the Gilbert and Rookwood node leaders (Dr Nathan
Waltham, James Cook University and Prof John Rolfe, Central Queensland University) and
relevant researchers from each university. For example, cross university discussions were held
with Prof Phil Brown (CQU), Prof John Rolfe (CQU), Dr Dianne Jarvis (JCU) and Dr Kamal Sangha
(CDU).

Proposing Org: DPIRD – water quality monitoring of agricultural runoff
The stage 2 farms of the Ord River Irrigation scheme have high environmental
regulations for farm runoff, given that the receiving environment (the Keep River)
is the habitat of EPBC listed species (e.g., sawfish, sharks). These regulations
include water quality monitoring. Responses to detection of exceedance of
pesticide/herbicides in farm runoff are currently restricted by 7+ day sample
analysis times. Sampling in the receiving environment is also challenging in the
wet season, due to road access.
Proposed project to investigate available data to understand chemicals in use
and their risks, then explore the potential addition of (1) quick tests (lower
resolution, but immediate response) and (2) passive samplers (to detect
presence/absence of chemicals) to the current ‘grab sample’ sampling approach.
Both additional approaches can inform management of the system to maintain
water quality in the Keep River, by providing rapid information on potential issues
(quick tests) and allowing post investigations if point in time samples missed key
events (passive samplers). If not prohibitively expensive, drone samplers may be
used to collect Keep River water samples during the wet season.

Potential add on investigations to investigate farm run off could include:
• a snapshot investigation of ecosystem health. This would likely involve
investigations into a lower order species (below sawfish) to collect
samples to look for evidence of toxicants in a part of the food web. This
investigation would serve two purposes (1) to potentially be used as a
baseline in case fish kill events occur, and (2) as a proof of concept study
which may lead to follow up research.
• Similarly, an investigation into the transport properties of various
agricultural chemicals, and information on how/when they are used will
allow modelling scenarios to investigate transport pathways and risks.
• Extended survey techniques to potentially identify the presence of other
EPBC species in the Keep River.
• It may also be possible to sample in the Keep River during the wet
season using drones. Wet season sampling has not been possible for
some pools due to safety concerns.
Elements mentioned here may be incorporated into the water quality focused
research project. The eventual design will depend on data availability, chemicals
used, and the available quick tests for the chemicals in use in the ORIA.

Proposing Org: DPIRD – Water use efficiency in the Ord River Irrigation
Area
Initially, the discussions for the stage 1 farms were framed around a cost benefit
analysis of the retrofitting of tailwater recycling on stage 1 farms. However,
discussions with a wider group of stakeholders revealed several questions which
should be investigated prior to any consideration of tail water recycling.
This project was modified to gain a deeper understanding of water use
approaches and views on water management in the ORIA. Discussions with a
wider group demonstrated that retrofitting tailwater recycling would only be
considered after many other water saving approaches were first implemented.

There is little motivation with the current approach for management to drive
water use efficiency. Thus, this project in its original form was not progressed.
Although, it should be noted that none of the stakeholders were against the cost
benefit analysis of the tailwater recycling, it was more seen that it was of limited
interest. There may be opportunities for a system to be retrofitted to the research
farm in the ORIA.
Additionally, discussions about retrofitting the research farm in the area with a
tailwater recycling system was discussed. This option could be progressed by
DPIRD, potentially with input from the Drought Hub.

Proposing Org: DPIRD: (DITT and others may benefit)
Elements of the proposed research below may be of benefit in both the Ord, and
other catchments. The research outlined below combines elements from
potential project options which were discussed throughout the co-design
process.
The design of the research requires two elements:
1. Through discussions/ questionnaires with farmers and DPIRD, identify
soil type, crops grown and irrigation practices. Through this consultation,
also enquire about thoughts on water resources management and their
potential economic implications for individual farmers and as well as for
the broader region. A mixed methods approach to understand water use
practices, future plans for changes to cropping systems and appetite for
risk could be useful in all catchments to assist departments with planning.
2. Demonstrate changes in crop type or irrigation changes (by soil type) in a
numerical model plant-water-energy model. Paring this analysis with an
economic/cost benefit analysis modeller allows the investigation of the
potential water use and economic impacts of potential changes (including
climate change).

Some of the management approaches in the Ord may be drawn from examples
in catchments that are unlike the ORIA. There is interest from DPIRD in the
production of a literature review on water management in tropical catchments.
The review could draw upon both Australian and international examples,
highlighting approaches used in similar catchments
The review would provide insights that may be useful in all nodes in the project
(as well as other catchments in Northern Australia). Somewhat similar studies for
groundwater have been recently published in the Journal of Hydrology: Regional
Studies.

There was a question of economics and surety of supply in the Ord. Currently,
the 95% surety of supply is related to the allocatable pool of water. Is 95/100
optimal to maximise economic benefit of the region (while providing suitable
reliability for growers)? To increase the allocatable pool (without needing to open
up more land), reducing the surety increases the volume of allocatable water.
However, the question is whether or not this would this drive increased economic
benefits.
This question has been incorporated into the project “understanding approaches
to farming and views on water management”.

The project was not progressed, given the high priority that was placed on the
investigation of optimal sampling approaches to detect agricultural runoff and the
impact that project could have on management of the ORIA system.

Priority research areas going forward
Detailed summaries of priority research proposals can be found in Appendix C. Of the above
proposed projects, the following are going ahead:
Topic Summary
Project 3.1 - Review of catchment/ water
resources management approaches in the
tropics.
This project is going ahead as it can inform
the management of the Ord River Irrigation
Area. While the review will be conducted
with the Ord in mind, it is expected to
produce benefits across Northern Australia,
and provides genuine opportunities for
collaboration across the three universities in
the Water Security Program. The review will
utilise available water allocation plans from
across northern Australia, as well as
research outputs from peer reviewed
journal articles, and recent reporting from
previous projects including TRaCK and
projects by CSIRO.
Project 3.2 – Improved water quality
sampling for agricultural runoff to the Keep
River.
Minimising the impacts of agricultural runoff
on the Keep River is of interest/concern to
both DPIRD and the farmer groups in the
Ord area. Current sampling approaches
can have large delays between samples
being collected, and the data being
returned from the laboratory. Investigations
into the potential risks from agricultural
chemicals in use, as well as potential
updates to the sampling design to achieve
optimal results are both highly beneficial
research outputs for the region.
Project 3.3 - Understanding the values of
water in the Ord River Irrigation Area.
This project combines elements of multiple
projects that were originally proposed. The
project was originally intended as a cost
benefit analysis of the installation of tail
water recycling. The installation of tailwater
recycling was identified as an approach that
would be considered only after multiple
other water savings approaches were
implemented. The research will be driven
by a mixed methods social science
research approach to understand farming
practices and farmers’ views on potential
water allocation approaches. These outputs
will inform a paired plant growth water use
and economic modelling.

Lower Fitzroy River catchment - Rookwood Weir
Node lead – Prof. John Rolfe, CQU
Contextual Background
The Rookwood weir project, which is jointly funded by the federal government and Queensland
government in partnership with Sunwater, is located on the lower Fitzroy River, approximately 66
kilometres south-west of Rockhampton (Figure 6). The construction of Rookwood weir, which is
managed by Sunwater, is estimated to cost $367 million and planned to be completed by 2023.
The weir is expected to provide approximately 76,000 ML of water per annum, of which at least
37,500 ML is to be allocated to agriculture (Advance Rockhampton, 2022; Queensland
Government, 2018, 2022).
Figure 8. Location of Rookwood weir in central Queensland

Source: https://www.rdmw.qld.gov.au/water/consultations-initiatives/rookwood-weir#about
The water from Rockwood weir is likely to support intensive livestock and significantly expand the
range of crops grown, including perennial horticulture crops such as mandarins, pecans, lychees,
mangoes, and table grapes, as well as broadacre crops such as soybeans and peanuts. There
may be opportunities for value-adding through processing and attracting more infrastructure
investment in the region. These advantages are seen to be viable, given that the region also
benefits from access to established agricultural logistics chains, transportation and port terminals
for connection with domestic and export markets. An assessment of the potential for irrigated
agriculture in the Rockhampton Local Government Area conducted by the Rockhampton Regional
Council on multiple criteria such as soils mapping and proximity to the river and key infrastructure
is shown in the figure below. This shows that suitability is quite fragmented and that multiple areas
along the river system exist where development might feasibly occur.
Figure 9: Mapping suitability assessment for irrigated agriculture in the Rockhampton LGA
Source: Rockhampton Regional Council
With the increased availability of reliable water from the Rookwood weir, macadamias and
mandarins are expected to be particularly attractive opportunities, given the strong growth in
production, profitability, and export demand of these products (Sunwater, 2020). For example,
Sunwater’s (2020) anticipated market outlook report estimates that net returns from macadamia
production within the Rookwood weir area would range from around $2,400 to $4,600 per hectare
per annum.
The development of Rookwood weir is expected to boost and maximise Central Queensland's
economy by $1 billion annually through the expansion of agriculture and multiplication effects
(Smith, 2018; Sun Water, 2020). Specifically, it will provide opportunities to shift towards more
integrated and value-rich supply chains as well as a more circular economy. This would present
45
the chance for the region to transition, grow, and intensify the agricultural sector to meet the
demand in the Asia Pacific market (Advance Rockhampton, 2022; Communities in Transition,
2019; Sun Water, 2020).
There has already been 30,000 ML of medium security agricultural water sold from the Rookwood
allocation, with a large proportion of this water allocated to the establishment of macadamias
(Rural Funds Management) and a 60,000 head feedlot (Mort and Co) in the Gogango area.
Currently another 7,500 ML of water are being tendered in up to 500 ML lots, with the aim of
supporting the development of smaller scale irrigation ventures. It is unclear exactly where new
agricultural developments will occur along the river system, but it is expected that the South
Yaamba district will be one area where growth will occur.
The Rookwood weir project is different to other past water infrastructure projects in Australia in that
the project is only about developing water infrastructure, and not the subsequent agricultural
development. Water distribution systems and other mechanisms to establish an irrigation district
need to be supported from other agencies and sources. An additional complication is that while the
weir will be built and operated by Sunwater, ownership of the water will reside with the Queensland
Government, as distinct from the existing Eden Bann weir and Rockhampton Barrage, where water
is owned and administered by Sunwater and the Rockhampton Regional Council respectively.
The need to improve coordination around development has already been recognised, with an
alliance between the Rockhampton Regional Council, the CRCNA and the Queensland
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries already formed to fund five research projects in priority
areas:
1. Defining a supply chain and development precincts vision
2. Visionary land use planning to facilitate development precincts
3. Mobilising strong water governance arrangements
4. Integrating nutrient, waste and energy streams in agricultural development
5. Achieving reef water quality requirements in new agricultural development.
While these projects have been recently contracted, a number of major information gaps still exist
about the challenges to realising the development potential in the lower Fitzroy region. Many of the
coordination, governance and planning issues are becoming more visible as the Rookwood weir
draws closer to the operational stage and industry grapples with the opportunities and challenges
of development.
There are two major reasons why the Rookwood weir and lower Fitzroy region have been chosen
as a node for analysis within the northern Australia region. The first is that there are a large
number of challenges in coordination and development for the new irrigation region that require
attention, particularly given the disconnect between new water infrastructure development and the
growth of an associated agricultural precinct. The second is that the Rookwood case study
provides a template of the issues that are likely to be relevant for future water schemes in northern
Australia, and hence identification, analysis and solutions design of the challenges that emerge is
likely to provide a useful template relevant to other regions.
46
Engagement with the lower Fitzroy River catchment stakeholders
The focus of the project was to identify through a review and consultation process priorities for
further research in the node to improve water security and agricultural development in the region.
Substantial material and expertise were available to draw on, including:
• Planning and advocacy for development in the lower Fitzroy region from the 1990s,
• Business case, approvals and design for the Rookwood weir from 2012 onwards, and
• More recent analysis and review work by the Making Water Work steering committee
over the past three years.
The issue identification and prioritisation work involved a number of approaches, including:
• Desktop review of key documentation about Rookwood and issues
• Engagement with Advance Rockhampton and the Marking Water Work steering committee
• A number of one-on-one interviews, including with staff and experts from:
o Advance Rockhampton,
o Rockhampton Regional Council
o Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (QDAF)
o Queensland Department of Regional Development, Manufacturing and Water
o Sunwater
o Regional Development Australia
o CQUniversity
o Agricultural sector.
• A workshop with QDAF staff (20th September).
The material from the different approaches was then drawn together to generate a preliminary set
of potential issues and research priorities for the lower Fitzroy. A workshop was then held with a
cross section of stakeholders on the 31st of October to test and refine the list of potential issues. A
final meeting was then held in mid-December to check the suggested research plan with the node
stakeholders.
Priority issues raised
A large number of issues were raised during the process to identify priority areas for future
research. These were grouped into 16 areas of potential research focus. Some issues fell within
the ambit of the five current projects in the Making Water Work portfolio, so were not considered
further. Some other issues were more aligned to government planning processes than research
priorities, so were also not considered for further analysis. The remaining issues identified were
grouped into six broad areas for further consideration, out of which four were selected as
particularly relevant to the lower Fitzroy and northern Australia more generally (Table 5).

Potential project 1: Prospects for specialty crops in lower Fitzroy region
Completion of the Rookwood Weir will create new opportunities for irrigated
cropping in the Lower Fitzroy region. New crops that have traditionally not
been part of the dryland cropping and grazing systems in the region will
become viable. These would include broadacre pulse and grain crops as well
as annual and perennial horticulture crops. While suitability of prospective
crops to soil and environmental conditions can be inferred from studies in
other regions, the decision by farmers to transition to new crops is strongly
influenced by locally generated crop performance data. This includes crop
economic data, crop performance data (e.g. pest and disease susceptibility),
and compatibility of the crop management with other components of the
farming system. On-farm crop performance trials and qualitative data from
growers on farming system decision making processes will support the
transition to higher value farming systems that utilise new irrigation
infrastructure.
There may be particular locational advantages in trialling pulse crops (high
demand, low fertilizer/pesticide requirements, potential to supply into feedlot
industry). The potential for biofuels will also be examined, because of potential
linkages to renewable energy sectors at Gladstone.
Research skills required: crop agronomy expertise is needed for crop
performance trials. Farming systems expertise and qualitative research
methodology expertise are required for research focussed on farmer decision
making and farming systems transformation.

Potential project 2: Prospects for agricultural technology into new
agricultural developments
Overview: Agriculture is entering a period of transformation, the so-called
Agriculture 4.0 or fourth agricultural revolution, with digital technologies and
automation delivering new agtech products and services to improve
productivity, profitability and sustainability of farming systems. Regions like the
Lower Fitzroy are in a strong position to capture the benefits of agtech as new
agricultural developments can incorporate the technologies at establishment
stage rather than retrofitting technologies into existing systems. Research on
farming system design that incorporate emerging agtech is needed to provide
growers/investors with strategies for developing Agriculture 4.0 systems. One
component of this activity is demonstration of available technologies and
applied research to optimise technologies in the farming systems as well as
generating ROI and productivity/sustainability gain data. This approach has
been successfully implemented in the Bundaberg region by CQU through the
Hinkler AgTech Initiative. The approach included detailed grower needs
assessment and building of new technology connections and knowledge
capability within established and trusted industry networks.
Research skills required: farming systems expertise and domain specific
agtech expertise is required for system design and tech trial research. Social
science research expertise to assist with qualitative research on technology
adoption and grower needs assessments.

Potential project 3: Optimising water quality monitoring
As part of the licence conditions for Rookwood weir, Sunwater have to develop
a long-term water quality monitoring approach. Currently regular baseline
monitoring is being undertaken at several sites above and below the weir and
a large number of parameters (about 250) are being tested (including > 150
pesticide components on top of physchem, nutrient and other parameters).
The costs of sampling and assessment are roughly about $3,000 per site per
event, so if there are multiple sites and regular sampling, the cost blows out.
For example, 10 sites with monthly sampling would be $360K/year, while 30

sites with monthly sampling would be $1.3M per year. These costs ultimately
will be passed through to growers as a part of water user charges. One major
challenge is to assess what should be done for sampling with major flow
events, as the regulators are very keen for high flow events to be monitored.
However, flow events are difficult and costly to monitor: a ten day flow event
with five sample sites and 12 hour sampling windows would add another
$300,000 to the monitoring costs (and bring the annual monitoring cost up to
$20/ML for Rookwood). This is a potential problem across northern Australia
where high flow events are common.
Options to streamline monitoring programs are to incorporate continuous
monitors and mechanical grab samplers into sampling procedures, to target
pesticides for testing from farm records or land use management plans, or to
use modelling approaches to extrapolate for data gaps.
Research skills required: Water quality assessment, monitoring program
design, statistical analysis, engagement and negotiation with multiple
stakeholders
Potential project 4: Developing minimum standards for feedlots in
northern Australia
Currently there is limited practicality for feedlots in northern Australia because
of the difficulties in operation in hot conditions and during wet seasons.
Designs and approvals processes are focused on conditions in southerneastern Australia, including southern Queensland. However, the opportunities
for feedlotting are particularly in the north, where there is currently a large
cattle herd and limited opportunity for value adding. Using new irrigation
districts to grow fodder for feedlots has some of the highest returns of all
options, as it avoids some of the transport and processing requirements of
other crops. If pressures increase to reduce live exports, then increased
feedlotting will be one option to maintain viability for the industry. However, it is
unclear whether it is feasible to establish feedlots in many areas and what
design and operating constraints would be required for their operations.
Research skills required: Animal welfare, beef cattle and feedlot performance,
supply chain logistics engagement and negotiation with multiple stakeholders

Project 5: Capacity building for traditional owners to be involved in water
enterprises
An allocation of water (500ML) from Rookwood Weir has reserved for
traditional owners. As well a large parcel of land is held by traditional owners
on the lower Fitzroy. However there has been very limited participation to date
of those groups in discussions about the potential use of the water. One
important area of work is to engage with the Traditional Owner groups and
help them to be more involved in decisions and options about the use of water.

Project 6: Model the upstream and downstream supply chain needs and
identify how synergies can create efficiencies
Input needs can be limiting for major developments, particularly when high
costs are involved. Examples of key inputs include equipment, fuel, labour,
electricity and fertiliser, all of which have been exposed to shortages or higher
prices in recent years. These effects are rarely predicted at a scheme or
precinct level because the issues of procurement and supply rest with a
number of smaller agents. However, if bottlenecks do exist, they will reduce
viability and create perverse incentives to focus on low value crops that have
smaller risks.
The project would combine direct engagement and modelling to build a
prediction tool for key supply chain requirements. To avoid undue complexity,
it would focus on predicting needs for key inputs by certain crops, so that
changes in water allocations or crop mixes will generate changes in input
requirements. The framework can then be used to extrapolate to potential
solutions, such as the housing and training needs of new labour force
estimates, or total fertiliser requirements at a precinct or district level.
A strength of the framework is that it can also be used to model indirect
outputs, such as greenhouse emissions or nutrient emissions. Then the effects
of solutions such changes in crop mix, moves to renewables or biofuels, or
changes in farm management can be estimated. Of particular interest are
options that create synergies within a precinct, such as the use of feedlot
waste for fertiliser into cropping, The predictive framework will be able to

capture the changes in inputs and outputs generated by these synergies and
provide some estimates of the efficiency benefits generated.
The model can be parameterised from existing irrigation operations, such as in
the lower Fitzroy and the Ord. The aim will be to develop a predictive tool that
can be relevant to all irrigation precincts in northern Australia
Priority research areas going forward
Four projects from the initial list of 16 potential areas for work were identified to progress:
Project 4.1: Prospects for new agricultural technology across northern Australia
Project 4.2: Optimising water quality monitoring
Project 4.3: Prospects for specialty crops
Project 4.4: Model the upstream and downstream supply chain needs and identify how synergies can create efficiencies
These projects were all identified as addressing major issues of relevance for the lower Fitzroy region where results could potentially
have major impacts on the viability and scope of future operations and developments. Further details are provided in Appendix D.
52
WSNA research project proposals
After 4 months of consultation with stakeholders in the 4 nodes a total of 15 research projects have
been prioritised (Table 6). Projects proposed to be carried out in each node have been taken from
the research priorities identified from each Technical Reference Group or advisory stakeholders. A
summary of each project proposal can be found in the Appendices of this report.
To understand how the various proposed research activities in each node relate to research in
other nodes, the 15 projects have been categorised into 5 work packages (WP) which reflect the
thematic areas which will be covered by the WSNA program. The work packages illustrate where,
even over a large geographic range, water security research priorities for northern Australia have
similarity or complementarity. The work packages are:
WP 1: Cross northern Australia
During the co-design consultation phase with stakeholders a number of research priorities that
apply across several or all of the focal regions/nodes were identified and supported by
stakeholders. These cross northern Australia research proposals have been aggregated into work
package 1 – Cross northern Australia. Each of these 4 projects will be carried out within a node for
the WSNA program.
WP 2: Water quality and the environment
A key priority across three of the research proposals is the monitoring and maintenance of water
quality within nodal catchments for both environmental and regulatory needs. These proposals will
support the baseline collection of pre-development environmental data along with determining the
best sampling methodology post development.
WP 3: Water availability and the environment
Four of the research proposals will look at above and below ground water availability within
catchments to better understand the impacts of current and future water extraction and how this
might be impacted by climate change. Knowledge based water allocation for catchments will help
ensure sustainable water availability to agriculture and the environment now and into the future.
WP 4: Cropping systems and new crops
Development of catchment infrastructure will create new opportunities for irrigated cropping. New
crops that have traditionally not been part of the dryland cropping and grazing systems in these
regions will become viable. While suitability of prospective crops to soil and environmental
conditions can be inferred from studies, the decision by farmers to transition to new crops is
strongly influenced by locally generated crop performance data. Two of the projects will investigate
crop economics, crop performance data and compatibility with other components of the farming
system.
WP 5: Supply chain and alternative economies
Input needs can be limiting for major developments, particularly when high costs are involved.
Examples of key inputs include equipment, fuel, labour, electricity and fertiliser, all of which have
been exposed to shortages or higher prices in recent years. These effects are rarely predicted at a
scheme or precinct level because the issues of procurement and supply rest with a number of
smaller agents. Projects in WP5 will combine direct engagement and modelling to build a
prediction tool for key supply chain requirements.

Knowledge repository
During the co-design phase in each node, it became apparent that many stakeholders, and the
research team in some instances, were not aware of key previous data or research relevant to
their node. Also, the project team had trouble accessing previous work that they knew existed.
Both of these instances point to the need for greater access to data and reports from previous
projects. Currently there is no central repository of this knowledge. Equal access to existing
knowledge and data sources is important for equity and greater understanding of relevant
development and environment issues. Thus it was agreed that, creating a knowledge repository of
such information for each node would be a useful activity of the WSNA program. It is envisaged
that this knowledge repository would store and make readily available reports and data relevant to
each node in a publicly available and accessible platform such as a dedicated website.
The WSNA knowledge repository will be a funded project within this program. Initially we will
consider the best way to approach this repository as all research institutions have their own data
repositories, such as Research Data JCU which is an integrated data management platform that
supports all stages of the Research (Data and Information) Asset Lifecycle. This platform helps to
maximise the efficiency and integrity of research, increases research visibility and impact, assists
with meeting compliance requirements for funders, publishers and the Australian Code for the
Responsible Conduct of Research. This platform would also ensure data and information is
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable under Australia’s FAIR Access Policy
Statement. This repository will ensure that documents and data for northern Australia are more
visible and managed to maximise knowledge brokering into the future.

Project description
There is limited, explicit, aquatic flora and fauna (including water quality) data completed in the
Gilbert River and the tributaries. Studies completed to date have been restricted to proposed
development precincts (e.g. Flinders and Gilbert Agricultural Resources Assessment) and
floodplain areas (TraCK). The Gulf Water Plan uses species data to test and set flow hydrometrics
for species presumed or historically documented in the region. According to Australian Living
Atlas, the sawfish (Pristis pristis) and the freshwater whipray (Urogymnus dalyensis) are known in
the catchment, with the sawfish listed as critically endangered under the EPBC Act 1999 (the
sawfish is an indicator species for development impacts on waterholes in the Ord River
catchment). This research project focuses firstly on completing an inventory of aquatic flora and
fauna species in the catchment, and secondly, overlay functional and lifecycle ecology trait
requirements on current distribution to understand the potential future risks to development in the
catchment (this same approach has been applied in the Ord River for example). These data will
assist State Government in the review of the Gulf Water Plan and preparation of the next revision
due 2027. In addition, the data will be useful for any planned future monitoring and evaluation of
development that commences in the catchment.
Methodology
The final location of sites will be determined in consultation with Gulf Savannah NRM, Indigenous
groups, Queensland Government (DES, DRDMW, DAF), Etheridge Shire Council, and
landholders. This will be completed in the first inception meeting and planning. The nominal
sampling schedule will follow annual surveys following wet season and late dry season.
Water sampling
During each survey, vertical depth profiles were conducted for pH, conductivity, temperature,
dissolved oxygen, and turbidity at two random locations, plus a third location at the deepest
position of each waterhole, using a hand-held Hydrolab QANTA (multiprobe) calibrated in the
laboratory before and after use on each field trip. Depth profile will be standardised to 0.1 m, 0.2
m, 0.5 m, 1.0 m and thereafter at each 0.5 m increment until approximately 0.1 m above the
bottom. On each sampling occasion, a single water sample will be collected at a mid-channel
position at a depth of approximately 0.3 m below the water surface. Samples will be stored in
portable 12V freezers (~–15 oC) until being returned to the TropWATER Analytical Laboratory for
61
further processing. Sampling method, sample bottles and preservation techniques, and analytical
methods, will be all in accordance with standard methods (i.e. DERM 2009, APHA 1998).
Water samples will be analysed for nutrients including nitrogen (total nitrogen, ammonia, nitrite,
nitrate, oxidised nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, urea, dissolved inorganic nitrogen), and
phosphorus (total phosphorus, dissolved organic phosphorus, filterable reactive phosphorus, and
particulate phosphorus). Samples will be also examined for Total Suspended Solids,
cations/anions (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO4), Total Organic Carbon, Dissolved Organic Carbon and
Dissolved Inorganic Carbon. A secchi disk (0.3 m diameter) will be used to measure water column
light attenuation. In situations where the bottom of the waterhole is visible from above, the
horizontal secchi distance will be measured instead. As a measure of algal biomass, a known
volume of water will be collected from the waterhole surface (0.3 m depth) and field filtered onto
glass fibre filter paper (Whatman GFF) to determine chlorophyll a concentration. A second water
sample will be collected to measure depth integrated chlorophyll a concentration. All water
samples will be processed in the TropWATER water laboratory in Townsville.
A calibrated Hydrolab multi-probe data logger (DS5X) will be deployed in the near-surface water
layer (0.2 to 0.4 m below the surface) to monitor the diel periodicity (cycling) of temperature, pH,
electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen at 20 min intervals. The loggers will be deployed for
between 24 hrs and 36 hrs during field trips.
Aquatic flora and fauna
Instream habitat will be assessed along a 100 m reach at location during all sampling trips. In
freshwater regions, instream aquatic plants (% cover and species present), benthic microalgae (%
cover), large woody debris (% cover along pool margin), leaf litter (% cover of substrate), sediment
substrate characteristics (% cover based upon Wentworth grain size classifications), and riparian
shading (expressed as the % cover over the waterhole) estimated. The extent (%) of habitat type
(dry, silty, sandy, rocky, riffle or run) within the waterhole reach will be also estimated. In addition,
climate conditions (cloud cover, wind), and hydrological stage (swift flow, recent flow, baseflow or
no flow) will be recorded.
Riparian vegetation condition will be assessed once per waterhole. Briefly, the width of the riparian
zone as a proportion of the mean stream width will be calculated from the most recent available
Google Earth imagery. Riparian vegetation condition will be assessed along a 100 m transect
parallel to the waterhole extending to the full width of the riparian zone. Within the transect, data
relating to vegetation linear continuity and the degree of bank protection offered by riparian
vegetation will be collected. Data were used to generate a score from 1 (poor) to 5 (very good). A
total riparian condition score for each waterhole will be then generated by summing the three
scores to give a maximum possible score of 15 and a minimum score of 3.
Aquatic invertebrate communities will be sampled at each waterhole using a standard dip net
(triangular frame: 0.3 m x 0.3 m x 0.3 m, 0.65 m bag depth, mesh size 250 µm). Sampling will be
stratified across different habitat types (bank edges, pool bottom, macrophytes) where available,
with three replicates completed in each habitat type. ‘Kick samples’ of benthic habitat within
waterhole environments will be collected at all waterholes (over an area of 2 m2). On site live
picking of aquatic invertebrates will be conducted for 45 min in total for each habitat type (15 min
for each of the three replicates). Specimens will be stored in vials and preserved in 70% ethanol
before detailed laboratory processing. Specimens will be identified to family level where possible,
although some of the more taxonomically challenging groups will be identified to higher taxonomic
levels.
62
Freshwater fish assemblages will be sampled predominantly using a backpack electrofisher (Smith
Root Model 12-B and an ETS unit), however, in deeper and more extensive waterholes we will use
a boat mounted electrofisher set up. Typically, the entire waterhole will be sampled (at least along
the margins) in a single pass, so that most or in some cases, the entire waterhole was surveyed.
Where feasible/necessary (particularly on the floodplain and in the estuary), a gill net (30 x 2 x
0.075 m stretch mesh) will be deployed for approximately two hrs soak time. Bait traps (0.2 x 0.2 x
0.4 m) will be set at waterholes for approximately two hrs soak time, though traps might need to be
set overnight to capture more nocturnal species. Captured specimens will be identified and
released immediately.
eDNA tracing of diadromous fish species
To complement the field sampling of fish species, particularly species that have a lifecycle ecology
that need to migrate between freshwater and tidal saline areas of river catchments (e.g.
barramundi and the nationally protected sawfish), we will also use environmental DNA test (finger
printing) where water samples will be collected extensively across waterholes and floodplains to
test for these species following wet season. This sampling technology has the advantage to
rapidly examine for DNA fragments of target species. This technique will complement our field
sampling where catching individuals is necessary to understand the stock structure, where eDNA
only confirms presence of species.
Field work permits and approvals
TropWATER has all the necessary approvals (animal ethics and government permits) to start
immediately. All the data collected with stored on JCU Research Data repository and will be made
available to any other partner as necessary. All data will be examined using appropriate univariate
and multivariate statistics for final reporting and publication. Any relevant historical data will be
used here, to assist in meeting the aims of this research project.

Project description
Seasonal rivers of northern Australia remain connected following the wet season for a period, until
flow ceases where they then gradually become disconnected and exist as a series of waterholes.
These waterholes gradually further dry as the season continues, some completely, through for
some that remain in a permanent state until the next wet season are critical freshwater refugia
habitat for species. While permanent waterholes are critical, they are also susceptible to poor
water quality conditions, particularly as the dry season advances, some reaching conditions that
are intolerable for aquatic life. The balance and risk that these permanent waterholes exist until
the next wet season means they are also at risk of land use changes, which might pose a threat
risk to their utility as important refugia habitat. For example, land use change might change
important limnological processes (i.e., making them more turbid, or changing the diel cycling of
oxygen and temperature) meaning they contribute little to broader ecosystem services. As part of
this research project we will also examine the surface and groundwater contribution to waterhole
permanency, using a range of techniques with colleagues from Charles Darwin University.
Methodology
Waterhole identification
Landsat 5 imagery or similarly available imagery will be sourced from current to as far back in as
possible (ideally 20yrs). All Landsat images will be orthorectified using at least 50 ground control
points to minimise image registration errors and results in a root mean squared error of less than
0.5 pixels. All scenes will be radiometrically and atmospherically standardised so as to facilitate
reliable comparison of radiance values over time. A catchment-specific calibration procedure will
be used for identifying the water index threshold best suited for the catchment. For this calibration,
the areas of individual water bodies will be manually digitised in Google Earth Pro.
Waterhole persistence and identification of key aquatic refugia
Waterhole extent was derived for each of the time series of Landsat scenes identified by
classifying pixels within the defined buffer zone as either water or non-water. This time series of
water body extent will be then used to track changes in waterhole area over time. The percentage
of time (i.e. percentage of available images) that a given pixel was classified as water will be
calculated as this provides a direct method by which to assess the persistence of waterholes
between years.
Relationship between streamflow characteristics and in-stream waterhole area
In order to assess the potential impacts of changed streamflow regime on in-stream waterhole
development (i.e. size, persistence), it is necessary to determine whether relationships exist
between waterhole area and streamflow. Historical streamflow will be modelled for each river
reach at the key gauging stations identified. Historical climate data to run the river model will be

sourced from the SILO data drill database, which provides interpolated historic daily climate data
on a 0.058_0.058 grid.
Groundwater contribution to surface waters
Groundwater contribution to key/important pools will be investigated using a combination of
hydrological tracer approaches. Tracers will include water chemistry (i.e. major ions), stable
isotopes of water and radioisotopes. Where relevant, microbial-based approaches may also be
applied.

Project description
Agricultural development in the Gilbert River catchment, despite available water for development
under the Gulf Water Plan, is hindered by the requirement to prepare extensive and expensive
environmental impact studies for each development (property) and, approval to clear vegetation for
development activities (which requires various approvals). Working with farmers who have been
collecting farm-scale data, specifically soil carbon data, and extending and complementing these
data with the trade-offs in other ecosystem services provided, including biodiversity, cultural and
water quality, this project focuses on examining the ecosystem services gained and lost for
proposed development areas in the Gilbert River catchment. These data could be collected across
several properties to road test requirements for development to help build confidence for approving
agencies.
Methodology
The main elements to this research project involve determining: carbon stocks in soil and aboveground biomass, biodiversity services including vegetation and habitat assessments, cultural
values and waterway/hydrology services that would be protected, modified or lost in place of
expanding irrigated agriculture in the catchment. An important part of this research project is to
gather all available data as part of determining baseline information for the hypothetical
development, in parts of the catchment where there is the potential to expand cropping (though
acknowledging that not al agricultural development will require irrigation). Farmers outline that the
biggest barrier to expanding cropping land in the catchment, and therefore accessing the available
water for irrigation, is the legislation and amount of information needed for approval. This project
combines expertise and skills in soil and vegetation carbon, biodiversity (terrestrial and aquatic),
cultural values and waterway/hydrology services. Specifically, we will undertake the following:
Carbon stock assessment
Carbon stocks in soil and vegetation will be assessed in developed areas and potential
development areas. This will exploit time-series data from existing vegetation and soil surveys and
farmer records, supplemented with sampling and analysis in key areas, with a focus on accounting
for spatial variability and changes over time under nominated management regimes.
Biodiversity
Vegetation assessments will be undertaken. These assessments will examine flora diversity,
abundance, cover and condition, following several condition method approaches that James Cook
University regularly use for similar assessments in the region for mining impact studies (data which
is used for compliance reporting). These surveys will also present the opportunity to confirm

regional ecosystem mapping and other available data for the catchment held by state, council and
landholders.
Aquatic instream values will be examined within the partner properties, and in the region more
broadly as part of Project 1. These surveys will describe the species diversity and abundance
occupying waterways and waterholes, water quality conditions, and state of riparian areas (intact,
impact from feral animals, erosion etc).
To understand the differences in biodiversity associated with proposed development, vertebrate
communities (mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds) will be also examined using a range of
baited cages, acoustic recorders, motion cameras, drift lines with traps, arboreal cover boards and
active searches. For comparison, and to understand patterns in the assemblage use of habitats in
the landscape, sample plots will be positioned in existing agricultural areas, and in vegetated areas
into which farmers may wish to expand. Sampling will occur several times each year, over the
three-year program. Importantly, sampling will take into account different vegetation types, terrain,
distance to water sources, disturbance and protected areas, as far as possible under the
circumstances. The data will be used in the overall assessment of development in the catchment,
and quantify risks to ecosystem services from water resources and agricultural development.
Development hypothetical assessment
We will examine hypothetical developments in terms of being feasible to supply water from the
likely storage options, soil types, topography, flooding risk etc for crop suitability. For example,
how large can the development be in terms of the constraints presented in the ecosystem services
assessment (for example, likely types of crop(s) and cropping systems which will affect habitat loss
and carbon balance. We will also examine within the development envelope, assess
options/scenarios to determine overall pluses and minuses in terms of ecosystem services,
including economics and related social benefits ideally, because any development is likely to be
detrimental based on ecosystem services along so it would be most useful to determine net overall
benefits. In addition, there is scope here to examine waterhole (Project 1.2) economic value, by
applying the Australian Water Accounting Standard (or similar framework) to understand the water
resource asset use, value and risk if not appropriately managed in existing development areas.
Government assessment
As part of this research project, we will road test the data and hypothetical development with the
regulators to define if the development would be approved, or if not, what additional data is
necessary for approval – or is the development just not possible. This project has the major benefit
of tackling the barrier to development, regulatory approvals, in a catchment that is under
subscribed in terms of water allocations. Meetings will be held with Regulatory groups in relevant
state and federal government to work through a hypothetical development, using the field data and
information. Several workshops will be held with government departments, in addition, to work
through the approval process, where the team will capture the learnings and information needed
for proponents to prepare and register development applications for expansion in the catchment.
The outcomes of these workshops will be a framework for development approval.

Project description
The Gulf of Carpentaria holds incredible Indigenous values and connect with Country. In some
instances, these values and connections with Country are shared with emerging leaders in
Indigenous communities. There is an allocation of water in the Gilbert River catchment for
Indigenous use, however, access and use of the allocated water has not progressed. There is a
critical need to work closely with TO groups, for them to drive forward in the identification and
documentation of cultural values in the Gilbert River catchment (akin to the Walking the Landscape
developed by DES). Preliminary research was completed during the CSIRO Flinders Gilbert
Agricultural Resources Assessment to identify cultural values in the catchment. In this research
project, there is a critical need to map out Indigenous cultural areas in the entire catchment, and to
develop a plan of enterprise development opportunities for water use that is prosperous for groups.
This project could be supported by the CRC for Indigenous and Environmental Histories and
Futures (JCU).
Methodology
Mapping Indigenous values
The Gilbert catchment has many natural resource values, high conservation areas and critically
important waterways for a broad range of goods and services. How these relate to cultural values
and desires is not known, however, and this project will work closely with the local Traditional
Owners to map out these critical areas and capture the values to ensure these details are used in
the revision to the Gulf Water Plan in the next few years. The team will work closely with the
Indigenous Ranger groups through engagement and consultation in the catchment to map these
values, and compare them to natural resource management areas in the region.
Review of Indigenous water resource enterprise
The second element to this research project will examine the potential water resource enterprise
options available to Traditional Owner groups in Gilbert, but also other catchments under the
NAUA. For example, in the Gilbert River, there is an allocation of water for Indigenous use,
however, to date this water has not been accessed. The reason for this is not clear, but could be
related to the ability to set up enterprise – not having the upfront capital funding or even land to set
up. This research project focuses on investigating ways that these groups could access water, in
addition to the barriers and scale of the opportunity. It will also explore barriers to implementation
of enterprise ideas, pathways to enable enterprise ideas and outline simple pilot projects/activities
to demonstrate and catalyse success.

Project description
Climate change has produced higher temperatures and modified rainfall patterns, which will
continue into the future. Future climate change is expected to impact both water security as well
and existing and proposed agricultural developments in northern Australia. While it is clear that
temperatures will increase in northern Australia, the projected changes in rainfall rates and
intensities are highly uncertain. To provide further understanding of the potential impacts on
agriculture, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) have recently produced the Climate Services for
Agriculture (CSA) tool (Australian Government, 2022). The CSA has tool been designed to
communicate future climatic conditions to the agricultural sector. The BoM have also produced the
Australian Water Outlook (AWO) tool (Bureau of Meteorology, 2022b) that provides gridded data
sets, both historical and projections, which can be used to inform current and future water
management decisions.
Various government departments including the Department of Environment, Parks and Water
Security (DEPWS, Northern Territory), and the Department of Water and Environmental
Regulation (DWER, in Western Australia) have flagged their interest in utilising climate model
output in future water allocation planning. In particular, DEPWS have demonstrated interest in
including projections of climate change in future Water Allocation Plans. DEWR have highlighted
an interest in including climate projections in planning around water allocations in relation to the
Ord River Irrigation Area, having utilised data from the BoM to inform planning in southwest
Western Australia.
Project 1.2 aims to utilise climate model outputs and the CSA tool to inform water management in
Northern Australia. While Project 1.2 will produce direct research outputs, it is expected to inform
several other projects. For example, the impacts of future climate change are of relevance in each
of the catchments in the Water Security Program (i.e., Daly - Katherine, Ord, Gilbert and lower
Fitzroy (WA)).
Methodology
While the CMIP6 global climate models, the latest generation of climate models, have been
recently released, the BoM tools (CSA, AWO) still utilise the previous CMIP5 model output, which
are presently better understood. Decisions on the model outputs to use will be made following a
preliminary review of the at the outset of the project.
74
The first phase of the project will involve collation of the required datasets, and a systematic review
of the available reports and peer reviewed literature on the impacts of climate change, with a focus
on northern Australia
Through consultation with BoM, the project will utilise the available data sets to project potential
changes to groundwater recharge, with targeted sites in northern Australia. CMIP5 data is
available through the AWO tool. Relevant temperature, rainfall and evapotranspiration datasets are
typically available in NETCDF format, which can by unpacked using the Python scripting language,
an area of expertise of Dr Irvine. Selection of appropriate climate models to use (specific models
shown to be highly reliable in northern Australia, vs. multi-model mean approaches) will be
identified through the project.
Investigations into potential changes in groundwater recharge at the catchment scale will draw
upon existing approaches that have been applied elsewhere (i.e., Crosbie et al. 2010, Mourot et
al., 2022), likely using climate model outputs as inputs for hydrological models.
The project will also provide outputs from the global climate models to inform other projects
throughout the WSNA Program. For example, the impact of climate change (i.e., temperature,
rainfall) is expected to inform investigations into cropping and water management/allocation in the
Daly and Ord River catchments.

data and review of available

and will allow impacts of climate
change to be assessed in other
projects in the WSNA program.

Work package 3 – Water availability and the environment
Project Lead
Institution
CDU
Project Leader Dylan Irvine
Start date Apr 2023 Finish date Mar 2026
Project description
Annual Announced Allocations (AAAs) in the region of the Oolloo Dolostone aquifer are
determined using a coupled groundwater-surface water numerical model. The model is run during
the wet season to determine the available water for allocation for the remainder of the (water) year.
The model currently produces a mismatch between observed and simulated flows in the Daly
River, with the modelled outputs requiring adjustment to appropriately reproduce field
observations, before AAAs can be defined. Further field investigations are required to better inform
the numerical models to improve model predictions.
The project aims to improve the understanding of the water origins of the springs that discharge to
the Daly River through targeted water sampling and to conduct investigations to inform the
conceptual model of the system to assist effective water resources management. The identification
of key springs to study will require input (and approvals) from Traditional Owners, the NT
Government and researchers. The study of springs provides opportunities to engage with ranger
groups and Traditional Owners to understand water requirements to sustain culturally significant
springs.
Working with Traditional Owners provides genuine opportunities for two-way learning about the
interactions between the Oolloo Dolostone and the Daly River and to understand how this has
changed over time. For example, knowledge of spring water origins from Traditional Owner
groups, passed through stories may provide useful input to inform the understanding of key springs
for management purposes. Developing a deeper understanding of the functioning of culturally
significant springs, and the hydro(geo)logical conditions required to sustain them can further inform
the allocation of groundwater in catchment areas of the springs.
Methodology
The first stages of the project involve collating available data and reviewing available literature. At
the outset of the project, engagement with Traditional Owners and the Northern Land Council
(NLC) is vitally important. Identifying which springs are of interest to Traditional Owners and can be
studied, as well as agreeing to data use agreements can take significant time.
To determine the water origins of springs, multiple water tracer techniques will be required, using
both spring and groundwater samples. Potential techniques include, but are not limited to:
Temperature: Temperature data are inexpensive to collect and can provide information on likely
source depths of discharging waters.
Stable isotopes of water (e.g., d2H and d 18O): Stable isotopes of water, d2H and d 18O, are
inexpensive tracers that can be used to determine whether or not groundwater recharge is locally
76
derived. When rainfall time series data are available, stable isotope data from groundwater or
springs can be used to inform the age of water.
Major ions: Samples for major ions provide multiple opportunities to understand spring water
origins. For example: (1) spring source temperatures (and as a result, depths) via so-called
geothermometers (see Keegan-Treloar et al., 2022). (2) Major ions can also be used to ‘fingerprint’
water origins.
Radioisotopes: Radioactive isotopes including tritium (3H), carbon-14 (14C) and chlorine-36 (36Cl),
amongst other naturally occurring radioactive tracers, can be used to determine the age of water.
Given that groundwater is generally expected to increase with both depth and distance from a
recharge zone, groundwater/spring water mean residence times can inform likely water origins.
Microbial source tracking: Microbial DNA-based tracers are relatively new to hydrogeology.
Microbial DNA-based techniques have been used in conjunction with hydrogeological tracers to
inform sources of contamination in other tropical catchments (i.e., Duvert et al., 2019). Utilising
complementary techniques can provide multiple lines of evidence, which can be a major benefit in
highly complex aquifer systems, such as the groundwater system that underlies the Daly River.

Start date Apr 2023 Finish date Mar 2026
Project description
The Northern Territory Government has recently released a draft surface water take policy that
relates to the take of surface water during the wet season. The policy allows for scientific
investigation to establish a maximum volume of water that can be extracted in a river basin. Where
scientific investigation is not available, the contingent allocation rule determines the maximum
volume that can be extracted based on river data over the preceding 50-year period. The
consumptive pool is based on 5% of the 25th quartile of Jan-March (i.e., the wet season months)
(Northern Territory Government, 2022b).
Understanding the potential environmental impacts of taking surface water during the wet season
was identified as an important research area by the Department of Environment, Parks and Water
Security (DEPWS). With the potential increase in the take of surface water, as well as the potential
impacts from more variable rainfall patterns, potential impacts on river floodplains (and the species
that they support) requires further investigation.
Surface water flows in northern Australia are highly variable. Even the Daly River, a perennial river
with significant groundwater inputs, can be highly variable. For example, total flow at the Mt
Nancar gauge was 11353 and 1843 GL/y for the water years (Sept to Aug) of 2018 and 2019,
respectively. Surface water take may lead to permanent reductions in river flows in both the wet
and subsequent dry seasons (Bureau of Meteorology, 2022a). The reduced flow conditions may
impact adjacent floodplains. Research questions relating to floodplains are interdisciplinary in
nature, benefitting from input from by hydrological and ecological disciplines, amongst others.
The specifics of the research design will be informed by a detailed literature review. Likely
components of the research include: (1) an investigation of the timing, frequency and duration of
floodplain inundation and relating these wetting periods to the water requirement of key species,
and (2) investigations into persistence and longitudinal connectivity of pools which act as refugia
through the dry season (or dry years). Both the floodplain (large rivers) and connected pools
(generally tributaries) questions have implications for the life cycles of several aquatic species.
Investigations will target rivers in the Daly catchment, the approaches implemented in the project
may provide a mechanism to inform management decisions relating to other rivers.
Methodology
Given that a significant body of work exists on the influence of surface water take on surface water
bodies and their associated floodplains, the first task is to complete a review of available literature.
For example, King et al. (2015) reviewed impact dry season take of water take on the hydrology of
ecology of tropical savannah rivers. Leigh and Sheldon (2008) reviewed impacts of water resource
development on selected Australian floodplain rivers. The review will refine research questions and
78
identify target sites for investigation, utilising peer-reviewed literature, and outputs from previous
projects, including research in the Daly catchment by Tropical Rivers and Coastal Knowledge
(TRaCK).
The relationship between river flows and the duration/ area of inundation of floodplains can be
investigated through the use of hydrograph data available for various rivers in the catchment (e.g.
Douglas, Daly, and Katherine Rivers) and historical remote sensing data/ aerial imagery. Pairing
analyses of floodplain inundation with the water requirements of floodplain species, through their
full life cycle, can inform potential impacts of surface water take. Including projections from global
climate models (i.e., rainfall and evapotranspiration) may allow the projection of future scenarios.
The literature review process will be used to identify knowledge gaps relating to longitudinal
connectivity of pools and will drive the selection of the target river reaches and species. The
project aims to inform thresholds whereby the lack of water availability impacts key species (for
example water levels required to maintain connectivity of pools, or to maintain riffles). The project
outputs are expected to first be driven primarily by a desktop review, followed by targeted field
validation/investigations.
Key outputs
Output Outcomes
1. Review of impacts of water

Start date Apr 2023 Finish date Mar 2026
Project description
The Daly River Catchment supports a broad range of agricultural activity including hay, melons,
and mangoes, as well as some forestry (NT Government 2022). A 2016 investigation identified that
for profitable broadacre crops to be grown in the region, a two crop cropping system is likely
required to generate suitable cash flow, with likely crops including peanuts, aromatic rice and/or
mung beans.
The catchment includes areas with existing water allocation plans, and those that are under
development. Of the available plans, the Katherine-Tindall Limestone Aquifer Water Allocation
Plan area is currently over-allocated, with no new water available. The Oolloo Dolostone Water
Allocation Area has not yet fully allocated its estimated sustainable yield, however, the northern
region was overallocated at the time of publication (2019). Additionally, water allocation plans for
the Mataranka Tindall Limestone Aquifer and Flora regions are in development.
The proposed work in this project is motivated by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade
(DITT), with a focus on the Daly River Catchment. The primary goal of the project is to better
understand current farming approaches, as well as understanding current barriers and potential
motivations to change. An improved understanding of farming practices will allow DITT to better
work with their stakeholders in the region. Knowledge of these various factors will be generated
through mixed methods social science research approach which will be applied to understand
farmers current approaches to farming practices as well as views on future change.
The outputs from the mixed methods social science research will be utilised with available soil and
climate data (both past and projected) to inform numerical plant-water-energy modelling and paired
economic modelling to better inform DITT to make management decisions and to support
agricultural development in the region. The project aims to identify cropping water use
requirements and to progress triple-bottom-line sustainable development planning at the
catchment scale.
The focus on water use requirements of the project also aligns with interests of the Department of
Environment, Parks and Water Security (DEPWS), who have highlighted that future water licence
applicants in the Northern Territory will be requested to provide realistic water use requirements in
licence applications.
Methodology
Current and future cropping in the Daly Catchment
80
A mixed methods social science research (i.e., a combination of interviews, workshops and
questionnaires, with the exact approach to be developed within the project) will be used to gain a
deeper understanding farming in the catchment. The goal of the research is to provide DITT with a
deeper understanding of current farming strategies, motivations to make change to farming
practices (or barriers that prevent changes). The research will support DITT to understand the
requirements to facilitate a transition to higher value crops. Potential benefits to growing higher
value crops on the available land may produce economic benefits and/or reduce the need for
further land clearing in the area.
Paired physical/ economic modelling
With the improved understanding of the approaches to farming, plus the collation of available soil
types, and likely future climate, several cropping systems can be numerically simulated. There are
various numerical model codes capable of simulating plant growth for given soil, climate and
nutrient inputs (e.g., LEACHM (Hutson and Wagenet, 1995), WAVES (Zhang and Dawes, 1998),
and/or APSIM, (Holzworth et al., 2014)). By pairing the physical numerical models with economic
modelling, the economic outcomes from various farming approaches can also be explored.
Understanding the water requirements of crops both currently, and into the future, can inform long
term planning.

Overview of research
The effective management of water resources is of increasing importance with the drive to develop
water resources in Northern Australia, and projected impacts from climate change. The WA
Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) suggested that a desktop
review of catchment management approaches to water quality management in tropical
environments would be beneficial. This suggestion was in the context of the Keep River catchment
where part of the ORIA lies or otherwise discharges to. The review of water quality management
approaches also applies to other tropical catchments in Northern Australia.
The focus on tropical environments is necessary, to ensure that the documentation of
management models and practices is appropriate and relevant to the ORIA. The review will focus
predominantly on examples of irrigation management from northern Western Australia, the
Northern Territory and northern Queensland, predominantly focusing on the Ord, Daly and
Burdekin irrigation districts). The review will also utilise peer-reviewed journal articles on water
resources management. Where relevant, the review may also draw upon international examples of
management approaches in tropical catchments.
The project will generate outputs (the review) that are of significance for water management in
Australia’s tropical north and will provide opportunities for genuine multi-institutional collaboration
across the universities in the Northern Australia Universities Alliance.
Methodology
The review will investigate the range of possible catchment management models that could
applied to the Keep River catchment. The review will document the merits, and limitations of
various approaches. The review will utilise a wide range of resources that focus on relevant
elements of surface and/or groundwater management with respect to water quality.
The first stage of the project will be to identify and refine the scope of the review and the context
for the management of the Keep River, namely to: (a) Delineate the Keep River catchment, or subcatchment for investigation, and collate required datasets to frame the context of the review (i.e.,
land use and its projected change, identify environmental discharges and likely risks), and (b)
contextualise the setting of the catchment (stakeholders, the local context and constrains
surrounding current management approaches). Following the first stage, the review will be
conducted. Relevant documents will be sourced from the Western Australian, Northern Territory
82
and Queensland government departments. Peer reviewed journal articles will be obtained through
literature searches using widely used databases including Scopus and/or Web of Science, and
relevant outputs from previous large-scale investigations in northern Australia (e.g., TRaCK and/or
CSIRO). Interviews with local experts are envisaged.
Following the completion of the final review, a stakeholder meeting will be held to discuss potential
implications of the implementation of a shortlist of potential approaches. Input from these
discussions will be utilised in the final report, where recommendations will be delivered.
The exact scope for the review will be driven by the literature search and further consultation with
DPIRD. However, likely elements include a historical account of water management in tropical
Australia, and environmental issues and their management (amongst others), and a summary of
available peer-reviewed literature. The review will be informed by (and differentiated from) recent
reviews of Australian water management, many of which include NAUA researchers, e.g.:
• Land use change in the river basins of the Great Barrier Reef, 1860 to 2019: A foundation
for understanding environmental history across the catchment to reef continuum (Lewis et
al. 2021).
• Hydrological processes in tropical Australia: Historical perspective and the need for a
catchment observatory network to address future development (Duvert et al., 2022)
• Sustainable management of groundwater extraction: An Australian perspective on current
challenges (Cook et al., 2022),
We would also propose to present the results of this review to a full meeting of stakeholders in the
ORIA, who requested this work.

Project description
The Keep River is the receiving environment of agricultural runoff from the Stage 2 farms. The
Keep River discharges to the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, on the Northern Territory side of the WA-NT
border. The Keep River has much lower flows, relative to the Ord River, and is the habitat of
Glyphis glyphis, Glyphis garricki, Pristis clavate and Pritis pristis, EPBC listed species (Hale,
2008), and potentially also the Northern River Shark (Glyphis garricki). Given the low flows and
presence of important species, Stage 2 farms have stringent conditions to monitor agricultural
runoff. Farmers are required to collect samples of stormwater runoff. Delays in sample analysis
times are a limitation to water quality management, whereby herbicide/ pesticide analyses take >7
days to produce results. A major question from DPIRD is how to manage the system while waiting
for the laboratory results. This limitation will become more significant as the ORIA expands into the
Knox Creek Plain.
Water and sediment samples are also collected from the Keep River via point in time (or ‘grab’)
samples when defined farm stormwater flow events occur. However, grab samples can lead to two
issues: (1) time delays in return of results, and (2) particularly in receiving environments, whether
the timing of the sample missed a key event. Additionally, inability to access pools in the wet
season limits sampling during these months.
Current monitoring approaches of agricultural runoff lead to uncertainties in the optimal approach
to manage the system. i.e., what if a laboratory result identifies concentrations exceeding limits
weeks after an event has occurred? The proposed research will first produce a desktop analysis of
mobility and risk of the pesticides used in the catchment area using the Pesticide Impact Rating
Index (PIRI, Kookana et al., 2005), or other suitable tools identified through the project. Following
the review, the second phase of the project may investigate the benefits of the inclusion of
additional monitoring strategies to the current sampling approach, and/or design an improved
monitoring program to provide DPIRD with more detailed information on toxicant and nutrient
levels to inform management of the system. Elements of the Project will align with research being
undertaken in relation to the Rookwood weir in the Fitzroy River (Qld).
Methodology
Phase 1: A desktop review will be required to identify crops grown, typical fertiliser applications
(e.g., timing, rates) and a list of pesticides in use. Collating these data will facilitate the PIRI
analysis to identify risks from agricultural runoff (including pesticide and nutrient runoff). Existing
water quality data (if available) will be compiled and reported. The process will also allow the
documentation of transport properties of agricultural chemicals in use, potentially allowing transport
scenarios to be simulated using the updated surface model being developed for DPIRD.
84
Phase 2: The data collation and PIRI risk analysis, can inform the design of an improved sampling
regime. The design of the sampling regime will be dependent on the pesticides in use, and
whether so called ‘quick tests’ are available for these pesticides. If available for pesticides in use,
quick tests may provide rapid information of the presence/absence of these chemicals. In addition
to the quick tests (if possible), the deployment of passive samplers (4-8 week deployments) in the
receiving environment are proposed to provide insights on whether field sampling in the receiving
environment has missed any key events due to timing of the sampling.
The overarching goal of the project is to inform the management of the system to protect the Keep
River.
Key outputs
Output Outcomes
1. Phase 1: Documentation of
pesticides in use and collation of
existing data and reports and risk
analysis.
Collation of data required to inform the
remainder of the project design.
Improved understanding of risks
associated with presently (and
historically) used pesticides.
2. Phase 2: Preliminary report on
proposed sampling strategy, with
preliminary demonstration of
revised sampling approach.
Improved understanding of
management actions to runoff events
and understanding of transport
behaviour of pesticides.
Demonstration of passive samplers to
identify validity of grab sampling
approach. If relevant, recommendation
on use of quick tests and/ or potential
proxies to provide more rapid
assessment of ecological risk.
3. Final report on the sampling
strategy.
At the conclusion of the project, key
results will be documented, highlighting
future research needs and possible
management interventions.

Project description
The original intention of the project was to focus on water use efficiency. The interest in water use
efficiency was motivated by recent years where water restrictions were considered due to low
rainfall. After discussions with DPIRD, the DWER, and stakeholders at the workshop held in
Kununurra, focus on water management approaches in the ORIA with wider a ranging scope than
simply efficiency was selected.
Water resources in the ORIA are utilised by a broad range of end users. Lake Argyle (10,760 GL
capacity) provides water for town water supplies, in hydro-electricity production (350 GL/y),
irrigated agriculture and to maintain environmental assets. Annual water entitlement limits for nonhydro-electric uses from Lake Argyle are 865 GL/y (Department of Water, 2014).Future use may
also include in green hydrogen generation. Water is managed to produce a high reliability of
supply, where irrigators receive their full allocation in 95 out of 100 years (Department of Water,
2014). The reliability of supply is directly related to the volume of water that can be allocated under
the scheme.
The ORIA has not had to implement water restrictions, or use Annual Announced Allocations, as is
the case in other water management areas. With the ORIA being in operation for less than the
100-year timeframe, and the fact that system is not yet at full allocation, the 95% reliability
approach has not been seriously tested. There currently no common understanding of the 95%
reliability approach and how it would be implemented in low water years amongst ORIA
stakeholders. The project will bring a broad range of stakeholders together to design and
implement a socio-economic investigation of water and water management. The investigations will
seek to define the 95% reliability concept, document stakeholders’ views on important water
management decisions and to explore the implications of water management on the economics of
the region. The project will focus on the potential impacts of changing the water reliability (i.e., a
greater area of land that can be used for cropping, vs. increased number of years requiring water
restrictions), and what potential impacts future climate change may have on water resources in the
system.
Methodology
The first stage of the project involves collating previously published data (historical, current and
projected) in the ORIA, including reservoir modelling scenarios, cropping information, climate
data/projections and water requirements of the current water storage system (i.e., requirements
the maintain dam walls and hydro-electricity generation). For example, future cropping scenarios
can leverage off of previous government modelling (e.g., double cropping and/or high-water use
crops). Projected water use requirements of the systems can consider current, or future
approaches (i.e., increased use of tailwater recycling).
86
Following the collation and reporting of the existing data/information, the questions to be posed in
the mixed method social science research (i.e., questionnaires, workshops, interviews) will be codesigned, involving local stakeholders. The design of the questions will utilise the report that
documents the current requirements of the system, as well the views of the stakeholder group.
Questions are expected to focus on two broad themes:
(1) To seek to reach a common definition/understanding on the reliability of supply in the area,
gauging the views of stakeholders on a range of topics, including how to manage/allocate
water in dry years, and
(2) To explore the economic implications of both the current and potential future reliabilities of
supply, including understanding the appetite for risk and views of water security vs. a focus
on growth. This component of the research can also focus on the water allocation
tools/approaches available.
Following the development and implementation of the social science research, results will be
collated and could be used to inform various investigations of the ORIA. For example, outputs may
be utilised to develop/inform updated reservoir modelling scenarios (conducted by DWER) to
explore the future reliability of supply. Models could consider different climate scenarios and
agricultural and other development conditions (i.e., green hydrogen), as well as water
management approaches.

Project description
Agriculture is entering a period of transformation, the so-called Agriculture 4.0 or fourth agricultural
revolution, with digital technologies and automation delivering new agtech products and services to
improve productivity, profitability and sustainability of farming systems. Regions like the Lower
Fitzroy are in a strong position to capture the benefits of agtech as new agricultural developments
can incorporate the technologies at establishment stage rather than retrofitting technologies into
existing systems. Research on farming system design that incorporate emerging agtech is needed
to provide growers/investors with strategies for developing Agriculture 4.0 systems. One
component of this activity is demonstration of available technologies and applied research to
optimise technologies in the farming systems as well as generating ROI and
productivity/sustainability gain data. This approach has been successfully implemented in the
Bundaberg region by CQU through the Hinkler AgTech Initiative. The approach included detailed
grower needs assessment and building of new technology connections and knowledge capability
within established and trusted industry networks.
The proposed work in Project 4.1 will establish a process for identifying and assessing the agtech
products and services with highest potential to benefit emerging cropping industries in northern
Australia. Where information from other industries using the technologies is available, case studies
of the technologies will be generated. Unbiased, independent assessment of emerging agtech
products is crucial for rapid adoption of technologies by industry, and the documented
assessments of technologies potentially applicable to northern Australian cropping systems will
facilitate the initial awareness and interest generation phase of the adoption process. Outputs
generated through this project will feed into Project 4.3 where evaluation trials by growers of
technologies they feel are most applicable to their cropping investments will be assessed.
Methodology
Phase 1: A list of commercially available (and late-stage commercialisation) technologies that are
potentially applicable to northern Australian cropping systems will be compiled. The project team
will undertake a technical evaluation of technology applicability (evidence of strengths and
weaknesses of the technologies) and farming system integration compatibility (how well does the
technology fit with other elements of the production system). A ‘potential future technologies’ list
89
will also be generated through a review of the literature and will cover technologies that are not yet
commercially available or likely to soon be available but could be game changers if the technology
ideas translate into viable commercial products.
Phase 2: A format and methodology for documenting unbiased, independent evidence of agtech
product performance and value for end-users will be generated. Research to identify key
information needs for growers will be undertaken to inform development of the methodology. This
process will be used to generate case studies for technologies identified in phase 1 that have been
used commercially and/or independently evaluated in Australia. These case studies will include
available evidence of product complexity, compatibility within production systems, trialability,
flexibility for modifications to suit specific farm needs, technical support requirements, and return
on investment calculations where sufficient data are available.
Phase 3: Information generated in phases 1 and 2 will be presented to growers in the lower Fitzroy
node (and potentially in other nodes if of value to projects being delivered in the Ord, Daly -
Katherine or Gilbert regions). This will facilitate design of technology evaluation trials by growers
engaged in Project 4.3 (and potentially projects in other nodes).
The overarching goal of Project 4.1 is to identify the potential for new agricultural technology to
transform the opportunities and prospects for agriculture in northern Australia

Project description
As part of the Australian Government’s approval conditions for the Lower Fitzroy River
Infrastructure Project (the Rookwood Weir Project), Sunwater are required to develop a staged
Water Quality Monitoring Program for the Project. Condition 1b of the approval specifies that the
Program must be capable of predicting potential, and detecting actual, impacts from the action on
the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and National Heritage place that may result from
changes in nutrient concentrations and oxygen levels due to decaying vegetation (i.e., the effects
of impoundment), and agricultural development facilitated by the action (i.e., the effects of land use
changes resulting from water sales). During the current construction phase of the project, regular
monitoring is being undertaken at 12 sites above, below and within the weir site, and a large
number of parameters (about 250) are being tested, including pesticides (>150), metal(loid)s,
nutrients and physicochemical parameters.
Given the size of the catchment, the sampling sites are relatively distant from each other and from
the regional city of Rockhampton. The long travel times to sites and the quantity of laboratory
analysis required for the parameters that are required to be monitored result in high monitoring
costs, at approximately $3,000 per site per event. With multiple sites and regular sampling required
over a long time period once the weir construction is complete, the overall monitoring costs will be
very high. For example, if ongoing monitoring is required at 10 sites, a monthly sampling program
would cost $360,000 per year, while monthly sampling at 30 sites would cost $1.3M per year.
These costs will ultimately be passed through to growers as a part of water user charges.
In addition to the cost of regular monitoring requirements, a major challenge is to determine the
sampling regime required during high flow events. High flow events are particularly relevant in
terms of water quality impacts on the Great Barrier Reef, so are of high importance to the
regulator. However, high flow events are difficult and costly to monitor: for illustration a ten-day
flow event conducted at five sites, sampled 12 hourly, would add another $300,000 to the
monitoring costs. Higher monitoring costs pass through to higher charges for irrigation water and
reduce commercial viability. In addition, there are logistical, and health and safety issues
associated with manual water sampling during flood events in large rivers like the Fitzroy. This is a
potential problem across northern Australia where high flow events are common.
Some options to streamline monitoring programs include incorporating continuous monitors and
automatic samplers into the monitoring program, to better target pesticides (and other toxicants)
for testing based on farm records or land use management plans, or to use modelling approaches
to extrapolate for data gaps. This project will investigate these and other options, to identify the
risks, costs and benefits of various sampling regimes.
91
Methodology
The aim of project 4.2 is to identify the potential for more targeted water quality sampling options
that reduce logistical challenges and costs, while maintaining an appropriately rigorous monitoring
program. The project will be conducted in four phases, as follows.
Phase 1: Assessing issues and risks – discussion and consultation with stakeholders to define
issues, desktop review of monitoring options, statistical analysis of Rookwood’s baseline and
construction monitoring data to inform monitoring requirements, risk assessment of monitoring
program options, ongoing coordination between requirements in projects 1.1 and 3.2.
Phase 2: Testing alternative field monitoring options – field trials of monitoring options in the
Fitzroy River, e.g., in situ loggers, automated samplers, passive samplers (metal(loid)s and
pesticides). Analysis of results in comparison to standard monitoring regime (consultants using
hand-held instruments and collecting water samples for analysis).
Phase 3: Optimising management of monitoring programs – access information on pesticide
use via individual land use management plans (Sunwater), irrigator groups, Queensland
Government agencies (note the potential to link with project 3.2). Collate information on other
monitoring programs in the area where data could be shared to reduce duplication (consult with
DES, FBA, regulated industries). Investigate modelling approaches to fill data gaps.
Phase 4: Cost benefit analysis of monitoring options – develop options for monitoring
programs, calculate costs and benefits of each option and provide recommendations for
Rookwood. The CBA and recommendations are likely to also be relevant to other northern
Australian rivers.

Project description
Completion of the Rookwood Weir will create new opportunities for irrigated cropping in the Lower
Fitzroy region. New crops that have traditionally not been part of the dryland cropping and grazing
systems in the region will become viable. These would include broadacre pulse and grain crops as
well as annual and perennial horticulture crops. While suitability of prospective crops to soil and
environmental conditions can be inferred from studies in other regions, the decision by farmers to
transition to new crops is strongly influenced by locally generated crop performance data. This
includes crop economic data, crop performance data (eg pest and disease susceptibility), and
compatibility of the crop management with other components of the farming system. On-farm crop
performance trials and qualitative data from growers on farming system decision making
processes will support the transition to higher value farming systems that utilise new irrigation
infrastructure.
There may be particular locational advantages in trialling pulse crops (high current demand and
growing interest in plant protein crops, low fertilizer/pesticide requirements, potential to supply as
forage source into the feedlot industry). Existing relationships CQU has with plant breeding
companies and the crop processing sector will facilitate access to pulse and grain crop germplasm
that the suppliers are enthusiastic to promote in northern Australia. The potential for biofuels will
also be examined, because of potential linkages to renewable energy sectors at Gladstone.
The research will compile existing information of potential cropping options and will incorporate
social science research to gain an understanding of current farming strategies, and motivations
and barriers to developing new farming systems and practices. This research will inform farming
system design planning; identifying prospective opportunities for new crop types, production
practices for those crops (including potential for new technologies), and integration of these new
elements into current production system components. Research trials evaluating new crops, new
technologies and new production systems will be conducted with participating growers to build
confidence for broader adoption of these innovations.
Methodology
Phase 1: A mixed methods social science research (i.e., a combination of interviews, workshops
and questionnaires, with the exact approach to be developed within the project) will be used to
gain a deeper understanding farming systems and practices in the catchment. The goal of the
research is to generate an in depth understanding of current farming strategies, and farmer
perceptions of the opportunities and barriers to adoption of new crops and cropping practices.
Consultation with growers will also contribute to design of new crop trials and trials of relevant ag
tech advances. Coordination between this project and projects 3.3 and 2.4 will allow a more
93
comprehensive, publishable data set to be generated on grower perceptions of new crop
opportunities.
Phase 2: Based on the outcomes of phase 1, and engagement with stakeholders involved in
supply of crop germplasm, a series of initial small plot crop evaluation trials will be conducted.
Incorporation of crop evaluation trial data into crop performance models (using APSIM) will allow
simulation of crop performance over a broader range of sites, environments and production
systems.
Phase 3: Technology (determined using project 4.1 information) and farming systems trials will be
conducted with participating growers, concurrently with phase 2 crop trials. Ground truthing of
technologies and both qualitative and quantitative data generation for assessment of benefits and
weaknesses of technologies and systems will be undertaken. This data will add to existing
technology case studies generated in Project 4.1 and allow new case studies to be documented
where no existing data were previously accessible.
Phase 4: Grower-led demonstrations of new cropping options, technologies and production system
components will be supported. This phase will be a combination of extension activities, designed to
assist farmers to make decisions on adoption of new crops, technologies and farming systems,
and trial evaluation research to add to the volume of data on new crop and technology
performance.
The overarching goal of project 4.3 is to identify the potential for specialty and higher value crops
and cropping systems and technologies to be to be introduced that will generate greater economic
benefits to the region(s)

Project description
Input needs can be limiting for major developments, particularly when high costs are involved.
Examples of key inputs include equipment, fuel, labour, electricity and fertiliser, all of which have
been exposed to shortages or higher prices in recent years. These effects are rarely predicted at a
scheme or precinct level because the issues of procurement and supply rest with a number of
smaller agents. However, if bottlenecks do exist, they will reduce viability and create perverse
incentives to focus on low value crops that have smaller risks.
The project would combine direct engagement and modelling to build a prediction tool for key
supply chain requirements. To avoid undue complexity it would focus on predicting needs for key
inputs by certain crops, so that changes in water allocations or crop mixes will generate changes in
input requirements. The framework can then be used to extrapolate to potential solutions, such as
the housing and training needs of new labour force estimates, or total fertiliser requirements at a
precinct or district level.
A strength of the framework is that it can also be used to model indirect outputs, such as
greenhouse emissions or nutrient emissions. Then the effects of solutions such changes in crop
mix, moves to renewables or biofuels, or changes in farm management can be estimated. Of
particular interest are options that create synergies within a precinct, such as the use of feedlot
waste for fertiliser into cropping, The predictive framework will be able to capture the changes in
inputs and outputs generated by these synergies and provide some estimates of the efficiency
benefits generated.
The model can be parameterised from existing irrigation operations, such as in the lower Fitzroy
and the Ord. The aim will be to develop a predictive tool that can be relevant to all irrigation
precincts.
Methodology
Phase 1: The first phase of the project will be to build a production model at the precinct level. We
will draw on production models for different crop types to parameterise it, and constrain the model
by relevant limits (e.g. available water). The model will essentially allow different mixes of crops /
production types to be entered up to the limit relevant to the precinct, and the resulting input
requirements (e.g. energy, labour, land, fertiliser) can then be estimated, as well as the outputs
(e.g. production, by products, wastes).
Phase 2: The second phase of the project will focus on one of the input (upstream supply)
variables for detailed analysis, identifying how supplies might be available over time under the
different scenarios. We expect to focus on labour requirements and supply strategies for this
phase.

Phase 3: The third phase of the project will focus on one of the output (downstream supply)
variables for detailed analysis, identifying how fodder production and by products might be used in
the feedlot sector, focusing on how to optimise production under different scenarios.
Phase 4: A key benefit of developing a precinct model is that it will identify wider input and output
streams relevant to emerging issues. Three areas of particular focus are of interest: new energy
requirements (and potential substitution with green energy sources), net greenhouse emissions
from the precinct development, and potential pesticide use under different crop mixes (the latter
will be a key input into the design of water monitoring programs).
Key outputs
Output Outcomes
1. Phase 1: Precinct supply chain
model

system model that demonstrates
linkages to upstream and downstream
supply chain elements under varying
scenarios
2. Phase 2: Upstream supply chain
– labour
In depth analysis of labour input
requirements under different production
scenarios and how they might be
addressed
3. Phase 3: Downstream supply
chain – feedlots
In depth analysis of circular and
downstream supply chain issues
focusing on feedlots
4. Phase 4: Intersection with
emerging pressures
Analysis of the energy requirements,
greenhouse emissions, fertiliser and
herbicide uses under different
scenarios
University / researcher involvement
CQU - Delwar Akbar; John Rolfe; Research staff
There are strong synergies between this project and projects 3.3 in the Ord, 2.4 in the Daly and 1.3
in the Gilbert, so we expect to build a team with CDU and JCU involvement that overlaps between
the projects.
Partnering organisations
We have had preliminary discussions with Queensland DAF, Advance Rockhampton and Mort and
Co on the research topic and will now work with them to identify their potential involvement.
